Review:
	clear , burnished copper-brown topped by a large beige head that displays impressive persistance and leaves a small to moderate amount of lace in sheets when it eventually departs the nose is sweet and spicy and the flavor is malty sweet , accented nicely by honey and by abundant caramel/toffee notes . there 's some spiciness ( especially cinnamon ) , but it 's not overdone the finish contains a moderate amount of bitterness and a trace of alcohol . the mouthfeel is exemplary ; full and rich , very creamy . mouthfilling with some mouthcoating as well . drinkability is high . great lakes christmas ale is my first beer from the best brewery in my home state of ohio and my former residence ( 3 years ) of cleveland . i 'm very impressed . i expected a good , solid christmas beer and those expectations were met and exceeded by a long shot . i only got a single this year , but you can bet that i 'll be getting more of this fine seasonal during my future trips home for the holidays . i would have no trouble at all drinking christmas ale year-round .

Review:
	picked this up in totowa since i never tried it before and this is prime season for this type of beer . while it was n't anything bad , this may have been the most 'plain jane ' hefe that i 've ever had one of most plain beers overall . it 's by no means a drain pour like the mass-market macros would be for me but there was n't anything memorable about this either standard pour to this with an off-gold hue and lots of cloudiness to it . the head reminded me of soda based on the sound and how long it lasted - lots of fizzle with little substance . there was n't any lacing to be seen and for the most part , that was the taste too . lots of starch like potato chips or crackers with just a hint of clove , bubble gum , and banana here . nowhere near as pronounced as its german counterparts and the aftertaste could hardly be detected either . just a bit of carbonation here too but nothing that detracted from the beer itself sure , it 's a bigger bottle but this was easy to down and if i had another , i might have opened that too afterwards . i came in with no expectations and left feeling the same way - not quite <unk> ' and not impressed either . i would n't mind giving other beers from these guys a go , if for no other reason to see if this brewery is middle of the road on all of their offerings . this is only worth a try if nothing else in this style is readily available .

Review:
	very dark beer . pours a nice finger and a half of creamy foam and stays throughout the beer . smells of coffee and roasted malt . has a major coffee-like taste with hints of chocolate . if you like black coffee , you will love this porter . creamy smooth mouthfeel and definitely gets smoother on the palate once it warms . it 's an ok porter but i feel there are much better one 's out there .

Review:
	poured into a snifter . produces a small coffee head that reduces quickly . black as night . pretty typical imp . roasted malts hit on the nose . a little sweet chocolate follows . big roasty character on the taste . in between i 'm getting plenty of dark chocolate and some bitter espresso . it finishes with hop bitterness . nice smooth mouthfeel with perfect carbonation for the style . overall a nice stout i would love to have again , maybe with some age on it .

Review:
	a very underrated ipa pours a <unk> orange color with a big head that lasts quite some time . taste is hoppy , with loads of pine-y bitterness , but also citrus flavors including grapefruit and ... is that a hint of tropical flavor ? maybe some pineapple . you see some nice malt/hop balance in quite a few of the better dipas , but this is one of the few ipas that 's both quite hoppy and well balanced superb mouthfeel and drinkability . ballast point continues to rise in my estimation with every offering i consume .

Review:
	poured from a 24oz bottle into a large sniffter appearance : this pours a deep bronze amber in color . this beer has some of the best head formation and retention that i have ever seen along with lots and lots of sticky lacing smell : tons of piney resinous evergreen aroms abound in this ale . cant get enough of this beer its the best smelling harvest ale i 've ever had the pleasure of enjoying taste : huge flavor profile with lots of bitterness and only a little malt sweetness . as this beer warms up the bitterness really dominates the flavor . i 'm tasting lot of subtle orange aromas mouthfeel : full body beer with alot of carbonation overall : i love this beer in my opinion its serria nevada 's best beer overall . the price is unbeatable i bought my bombed for $ 3.99 . so much flavor and biting bitterness this harvest ale has no equal .

Review:
	poured from a 12oz bottle into a delirium tremens glass . this is so hard to find in columbus for some reason , but i was able to get it in toledo ... murky yellow appearance with a very thin white head . the aroma is bready and a little sour . the flavor is really complex , with at least the following tastes : wheat , spicy hops , bread , bananas , and a toasty after-taste . it was really outstanding . i 'd recommend this to anyone , go out and try it . i think it 's the best so far from this brewery .

Review:
	thanks to tenderbranson69 for sharing this bottle , poured chilled into a willybecker a - a very hazy dark amber w/ 2.5 fingers of rocky light tan head , thick lace collects on the glass like webbing s - a strong sweet fruit like candied citrus and honeyed pineapple w/ a hint of mango and papaya w/ a subtle green tea tinge like herbs w/ a gentle <unk> acidic nose m - the feel is delightful and not at all what you would expect considering the fruit filled aroma - not overly sweet . the texture is aided by tingling carbonation and mild juicy fruity notes w/ light sweet and nutty/woody earthy tinges and mild acidity w/ a semi-sweet finish . the astringent aspect is mild w/ alcohol only noted in very slight ways t - a lot of tropical fruit and white grapeskin flavor like gooseberry w/ a mild pineapple and sweet pine w/ herbs , tea and lychee w/ a hint of mango . the flavor is accented by sweet but not syrupy malt that accompanies a mild pear and pine taste w/ very very light minty clean elements . the taste of citrus is there but enveloped by papaya and passionfruit w/ an alcohol flavor and resinous slightly bitter finish . the finish is semi-dry w/ a refreshing flavor -more than any other single hop ale i have had . d - i found the taste of this to be like fruit in peculiar fresh hoppy aspects w/ great drinkability and bitter/sweet blend which is intensely packed with nelson sauvin hop goodness - juicy and delicious .

Review:
	well , it 's not really a kriek , and not really a flander 's red either -- somewhere in between . the beer base is a stanard sour belgian beer with tart berry notes , hints of vineous and woodiness and a hint of funk . the body lacks the firm malt base for a flanders , but not candy-sweet enough for a kriek but does show subtle character of both . a mild malt base struggles to support the sourness and cherry flavors but does keep the beer from complete astringency and thinness . hops are light , but do show some american citrus notes which i find quite pleasant . somewhat lemony and berry-like to go along with the added fruits . still a fine beer that i enjoyed quite well , but it does n't represent styles well -- let 's just call it a belgian sour beer with cherries added .

Review:
	i really did not like this . it just seemed extremely watery . i dont ' think this had any carbonation whatsoever . maybe it was flat , who knows ? but even if i got a bad brew i do n't see how this would possibly be something i 'd get time and time again . i could taste the hops towards the middle , but the beer got pretty nasty towards the bottom . i would never drink this again , unless it was free . i 'm kind of upset i bought this .

Review:
	poured chilled ( 50 degree f ) into a pint glass , it pours the color of honey with a cloudy , honey-like body . about 1 finger thick of eggshell colored head sits atop the body but then dissipates to a surface layer with just a bit of lacing around the edge of the glass . aroma is quite mild . some slight malt hits the nose , but by hitting i mean hitting like 'a girl ' flavor is quite sweet malt with a nice hoppiness coming through on the finish to help balance it . however , this is mostly watery and not very flavorful body is a little chewy for a pilsner , but thirst quenching and quite easy to drink . i would n't drink this if i wanted to drink something with boisterous taste , but i 'd drink it for hours on a hot summer day .

Review:
	appearance : why is it characterized as <unk> ' black ? like , this stuff is black , but how does that equate to a jet smell : very roasty and a little bit of earthy hops . coffee , and chocolate . taste : coffee , chocolate , and a slightly estery yeast flavour . mouthfeel : smooth is such a generic term . this beer is small-bubbled and delicious . there 's definitely a lot of hops that were thrown in the boil . drinkability : much like their java , the alcohol is there in intoxication , but almost absent in taste and aroma . this makes it excessively easy to drink . the bitterness makes it a little charcoal-y but holy crap , what an incredible beer . overall : i 'm happy with this beer , but way too expensive . over $ 10 per bottle , i 'd probably rather have a brooklyn black chocolate stout . they 're extremely similar , but this stuff is really nice .

Review:
	served on tap in a pint glass , this is an absolutely clear golden straw color with big fomay white head with decent retention and tons of carbonation bubbles . nose is pretty faint , some grassy hops , a little malt , nothing else . taste is a sharp spicey hop over a light grainy malt -- very melded together , not much going on , but satisfying . as the beer warmed some slight lemony flavors crept in . bodies on the thin side , but it has a nice carbonation and a great crisp finish . overall this is a solid pils , nothing to write home about , but definitely a good offering that you can find at a decent number of bars .

Review:
	i was handed a glass of this unusual beer at a small party this evening and i was told it was something special from belgium . i put my nose to it right away to ascertain it values after being told it was a lambic . i thought the fragrances of tart apples and fruit were going to knock me out or at least scare me away from enjoying it . the first taste was a very spicy and tart flavor that made me question , like many other belgian beers i had tasted recently , was this made from apples and hard cider . i put the glass down to taste the home brewed version of poor richard 's i had made with great success . it 's smooth sweet flavor contrasted well with the lambic which i thought may have needed more time to settle . i remarked that while this could be found at whole foods , i did n't think it would be served in shea stadium anytime soon as one needed a lot of time to go over it to find its reason of being .

	1 1/2 finger head with excellent retention . nice amber color . retention sticks around for almost the entire experience . smell is a little faint and only floral notes come out . it 's hard to pick apart . taste is nicely balanced . malty caramel and pale malts upfront mix with a piney citrusy bitterness in the back . not over the top in bitterness , but a hop fix with a nice malt backbone . crisp and very smooth mouthfeel . very full on the palate . this beer was very easy to drink and was quite well balanced . i could make a session of it easily .

Review:
	very dark and opaque with a nice light tan head , incredibly foamy and beautiful to look at . lacing is present , but not very consistent . smell is exquisite , extreme coffee grounds , espresso and roasted malts . i pick up bits of burnt wood in the background and a little chocolate , even whiffs of oatmeal , wonderful aroma . taste is quite understandably coffee grounds , however not as dominantly as i would assume . the coffee blends fairly well alongside milk chocolate , dark chocolate , and espresso . there is also some <unk> and a chocolaty aftertaste . medium to full bodied , but quite smooth with alcohol completely hidden . it would be hard to drink several of these due to the infusion of coffee , but something i would drink again . i 'd even recommend this to <unk> thanks to its balance .

Review:
	( served in an american pint glass ) a- this beer has a hazy lemon yellow body with a snow white head that fades after a bit . the body is a bit too dense to see much carbonation s- this beer has a light tartness with a faint lemon zest note to it . there is a light dryness to the smell at the finish . t- this beer has a smooth dry soft wheat flavor with a nice soft pine note and citrus zest note at the end . as the beer warms there is a nice dry spice warmth that taste faintly of coriander m- this beer has a light mouthfeel and a clean finish d- this beer has a nice dry yet fruity crisp taste to it that overs a nice refreshing change from so many bland wit beer . the dryness with some complexity and the light body make this beer pretty quaftable .

Review:
	another new one ( as of this date ) from anacapa . and a good addition to boot orangy body with a smallish white head . smells a little fruity , like orange maybe . i can definitely smell the hops too . tastes of hops mainly and some orange in there as well . mainly it 's a bitterness that hits your tongue . it 's not overwhelming by any means , it 's just the main flavor/feel on the tongue . a light medium mouthfeel to this one . pretty darn drinkable , especially on a hot so cal summer day . this is a great beach day sipper .

Review:
	appearance - darkish deep amber orange color that is very cloudy . pours about an inch of off white head when poured violently . head quickly dissipates into a thin film that leaves hardly any lacing . not too unexpected with the style and gravity . smell - dark fruits with lots of cherry and plum to start . alcohol is definitely evident , but so are a moderate amount of sweeter hops . maybe a bit of caramel/vanilla scent , something sweet . taste - there is a big sweetness off the bat with this barleywine , that does n't really fade too much . alcohol flavor lasts throughout also , with the same characteristics of the smell here as well . cherry , plum , and raisin dominate the palate . kind of one dimensional in terms of flavors mouthfeel - moderate to high carbonation , with a pretty viscous and thick coat left on the tongue overall - i feel like this is a slightly better than average beer . i do n't have too much to compare it to stylewise , but i will say that you know how much alcohol you 're taking in while drinking this . southern tier does not normally disappoint , and they did n't necessarily here either , but they also did n't really excite me either .

Review:
	12oz bottle split with onix1agr . a- pours black with mahogany edges . nice small cap of coffee colored dense and creamy head that settles to a faint ring and some small islands of fizz . s- <unk> of bourbon and dark roasted almost burnt malts . port and molasses , booze soaked blackberries , brown sugar t- well the bourbon takes the lead and never gives it up , this is not to say that its all booze . lots of some of the roastiest malts this tongue has ever come across and a blackstrap molasses sweetness . port soaked dark fruit and bruleed brown sugar on top . the wood plays a nice earthy role and adds some faint vanilla m- medium to light body and about he same in carb . i remember this being thicker and lively but this is a well aged bottle of a huge brew . i really like how the barrel imparts almost a wood grain texture to the mouthfeel . long linger . d- well its not an every day kind of beer , hell its not even a whole bottle kind of beer , but that being said this stuff is super complex and a true whiskey bomb . not for the faint of heart but if you like em from the barrel this one is for you .

Review:
	poured into snifter glass a : rich golden amber hue , finger of so of head that dissipated somewhat quickly s : wonderful tripel nose . the alcohol is there but hints of fruit . i caught tones of apple and possibly cherry in the nose . i really enjoyed the nose on the beer . t & m : wow this is a tart tripel . the one the thing on the taste that i noted was the strong hints of cherry . the finish is so dry but is very pleasant . mouthfeel is tart as well , leaves hints of that with aftertaste . d : drinkable but high abv would prevent more than one or two in a sitting . i am a tripel fan and this moves up on top of the list with la fin du monde .

Review:
	12 oz bottle poured into duvel tulip . bottle reads 'ale brewed with chamomile flowers ' - i do n't think i 've ever had chamomile in anything but tea , so i 'm not sure what to expect pour is a crisp gold color with some haze , 1 finger head quickly dissipates leaving no lacing . aroma is subdued wheat with some banana and a few other fruits i ca n't place ; there is n't much to the nose at all . there is n't a lot going on with the first sip - more than anything else it comes across with a crisp finish . maybe i do n't know what to look for with the chamomile , but i ca n't taste it at all . mouthfeel is much more interesting - it 's medium-bodied and a bit creamy , but leaves a distinctly clean and refreshing feeling on my palette after each sip . definitely a good choice for a hot summer afternoon outside . overall there is n't a lot to this beer , but i think that 's just fine . i 'd describe this as a lawnmower beer , but one that you would n't have any qualms about reaching into the cooler for again and again .

Review:
	ah ... time for dessert . acquired this at the local trader joes for $ 4.99 a 4-pack . poured black as tar with a medium brown head that lasted longer than i thought considering the style . the aroma was of chocolate , coffee , cherries and alcohol . the taste was bittersweet . dark chocolate , roasted malt , a bit of molasses all balanced by a spicy hop aftertaste that lingered rather nicely . this beer got more complex as it warmed with a smokiness and hints of currant and licorice . finishes dry with a definite alcohol warming . quite the tasty morsel and exceptional for the price . get thee down to your local tj 's and stock up

Review:
	pours a deep dark black with a firm offwhite head about a half inch thick leaving a tiny lace . aromas are of chocolate and roasted malts , along with some alcohol and a little dark fruit as well ( maybe even some courants ) . for taste this beer starts off initially with its big strong malts showing off some bittersweet chocolate , and a nice roasty flavor with almost a little smoke intertwined in there . following some of the dark fruits shine through with almost a bit of tart sourness , but those flavors are quickly overwhelmed by more dark malts and a little coffee . this beer finishes smooth with a nice bitter hop finish that lingers on the tongue . a nice full body to this beer with a like carbonation and full flavor makes this beer a classic .

Review:
	a : pours a lot darker that i thought it would and that was a pleasant surprise . this is a jet black beer with a pretty dark head s : wonderful smell of roasted malts , chocolate , little bit of java , and beautiful blueberries . t : i was very impressed with this beer . i usually am not a big fan of fruit flavors in beer , but this beer was definetly an exception . the blueberries were never overwhelming , and were definetly an awesome touch to this stout m : it was a little bit thinner than i thought it would be . d : honestly i could drink these all day . especially good for this time of year . this was my first dark horse brew and i will definetly be looking for more .

Review:
	another great beer from hoppymeal , poured into a snifter . this one is really dark , pitch black with an aggressive pour producing a short-lived tan head that recedes very quickly to a small ring . there 's not much lacing , but there are boozy legs lining the glass after each sip . aroma is definitely boozy with some heavily roasted dark chocolate malts and dark fruits . caramelized sugar and licorise lend a bit of sweetness to things . there seems to be a smoked character to the aroma as well the taste is sweet with lots of licorice and molasses before the burnt malts take over in the middle . the finish is dry and boozy with a lingering bitterness from the charred malts . the mouthfeel is heavy and slick with very little carbonation . this is definitely a sipper and a good beer , but it 's definitely not in the top tier of impy stouts . the drinkability is always going to be limited with an 18 % abv but it 's not completely overpowering on the palate .

Review:
	when wheat beers and lighter bock beers meet , we 're given a unique blend of malt depth , fruity esters , and elevated alcoholic strength . upon the decant , the beer delivers a beautiful golden-amber color and a magnificent bright appearance . creamy head character of stark white foam laces with a lot of decorative patterns on the glasss . impressive appearance overall . malty aromas of bread crust , elegant pilsner malt , light toffee , and a rich bready flavor of fresh baked breads along with caramelized grains carry a vibrant and fresh aroma . a contribution of herbal tea-like hops give a light floral note to the rich malt scents . delicious and with a lot of finess when considering the malt profile . though strong in alcoholic taste , the firm maltiness delivers a mild toffee taste along with a lot of melanoidin flavors of bread crust , savory caramelization , and succulent fresh bread flavors . with just enough herbal and floral hop flavor to decorate the peripheries of malt flavor and with the slightest offset from sweetness , the beer shies away from sweetness in favor of true malt flavor in finish . sweetness is lightly amplified by the fruity/floral flavors of orange <unk> , apple pie , and marmelade . creamy and a bit oily from the focus of malt richness and wheat , the beer carries a consistent texture from early creaminess through late fullness until the strength of alchol breaks apart the beer and allows for an alcoholic semi-dry finish . a hint of oily feel comes out of the <unk> note and may offer the slightest of distractions . the rich and savory melanoidin notes of the beer definately set it appart from other beers of it 's type that do n't take as much care . but the oily malt character offers just a slight flaw in taste and texture .

Review:
	a- poured to a light yellow color , that had a white head that didnt last long . had a little i mean little lacing . s- smelled a little like bananas and citrus . there wasnt a lot of smell here period . t- there really wasnt a lot of taste . just a little taste of bananas . then again , a very little taste . almost like drinking water . m- felt like water in the mouth . i thought the carbonation was a little too much . d- i wont buy these again . there wasnt any flavor that you would crave . berghoff really makes some good beers . this isnt one of them .

Review:
	12 ounce can dated <unk> poured at 43 degrees with slight head that did not have much retention . clear , pale and watery with a few small bubbles . unable to detect any malt or hops watered down taste of a cold lager . nothing off but not able to describe anything exciting . this is more drinkable in the summer when a good light thirst quencher might be needed .

Review:
	brought home a bottle of six pack of this when we went down to pittsburgh to see the sox . we can thank ale street news for the brewpubs locations in pa . great place for a slight detour on my birthday on the way into pittsburgh . appearance : hazy orange color with a decent amount of carbonation . slight head that has remained in the pint glass . smell : slight piney hop profile and bigger caramel malts are the only thing that comes out to me . also get some slight hints of grapefruit . the beer could use a better hop profile since the malts take over the majority of the aroma . taste : piney , malty , and citrus/grapefruit notes on the palate . the ingredients fit the style fine , but could have a cleaner taste that is more noticeable mouthfeel : slightly smooth , a little chewy , and medium carbonation . overall : not a bad ipa and happy that i was able to try this at the brewpub , bring it to the hotel , and have beers make it all the way back up here to lovely dorchester . if i am ever going to pitt again , this brewpub and beer will be in the agenda . only 20 minutes out of town too .

Review:
	pours a rather crisp yellow almost orange with a thin head . the aroma is dominated by sweet malts with just a slight hoppiness dancing in the background . the taste does have a surprising amount of hoppiness for a pilsner . there is a good maltiness to it as well , but citrus hops just slightly overpower . the beer is very light and refreshing . this makes for an excellent summer session beer .

Review:
	i picked up this bottle in greenville sc a few weeks ago . the beer is dark yellow orange color , a little hazy , with a thin head . this has more of a spicy tripel aroma than ipa . i 've had several beers of this tripel/ipa blend variety and have n't really been taken by any of them . this is turning out to be much of the same , with less ipa and more tripel in the smell and taste . well done for what it is i guess , but not something i 'd search for again .

Review:
	pours a dark amber color with decent head that does not recede much . it 's a tad too dark to see the carbonation , but fairs well . smells of roasted malts and mouthfeel is quite strong in the sense that you can get a good taste of it before you even swallow . there is a slight dryness to the aftertaste with a nice ballance of hops . there is also a good nutty malt taste too . this is the second ayinger i 've tried after celebrator doppelbock . this is n't quite as good as that , but it 's still up there . i give this a thumbs up .

Review:
	a - dark brown with a crimson tint . out of the tap , only a tiny head and there was no lacing . s - slightly dark coffee aroma with a touch of molasses . t - dark malt mostly , a mild sweet chocolate meshed with a much stronger burnt flavor . a mild grassy/citrusy hop taste is there as well . aftertaste is short lived burnt flavor . m - smooth , refreshing , slick , no complaints here . d - easy to drink . since abc always has about 10 different beers on tap , it is likely that i wo n't have this again , i 'd rather try the others , but i would n't mind having this again . nothing spectacular , but certainly enjoyable .

Review:
	`` another new england gem courtesy of bkett01 . '' thanks again , brian pours a hazy , unfiltered looking burnt gold . a little paler than most ipa 's , i think . smells like a hop field , there 's no two ways about it . fresh grassy green scent with an undercurrent of spiciness . hop taste starts with a citrusy bite , escalates further into spicy grass notes , and rounds out into <unk> bitterness . just when the ride looks over , some malt creeps in to provide a little balance . very nice beer here , one i would love to have available on a regular basis . now i want to try the rest of smuttynose 's line , to see how they compare .

Review:
	pours a rich viscous black with a creamy tan head that patiently gives way to a thin , but sticky lacing . aroma consists of opulent roasted malts and milk chocolate , both of which become more pronounced as the beer warms . there may be some wood-like hop notes buried as well . tasty flavor of malt , chocolate , and wood with earthy hops and a touch of booziness as the beer warms . the wood aspects re-appear at the finish with more hop bitterness and a hint of the sweet chocolate . this beer is thick and palate coating with medium carbonation and quite a kick to it between the alcohol , roasted malt , and wood hops . this is one of the heavier beers i have had in a while , and even a bit so stylistically speaking , however the aromas and flavors are quite enjoyable making a a good beer .

Review:
	now quaffing : arcadia batch # 999 'hop fueled ' my first offering from arcadia . pours a hazed sepia with a good amount of yeast sediment peppered throughout . carbonation is mild and the does n't stick around long . lacing is sticky and has no problems remaining after each sip . aromas are an oily pine with a slight sweet floral character . the taste brings forth a nice dose of the resiny pine hops and sweet grapefruit . mouthfeel is fairly full and very slick with each sip -- nice and smooth . each sip finishes somewhat sweet and slightly dry with just a touch of bitterness lingering . i would believe you if you told me this was a hybrid of english and american ipa styles , as the hop profile seems to suggest influences from both . i wish i could get more of this one , because its a nice change over some of the sharper domestic ipas and dipas .

Review:
	a darkish golden pour from tap with a small white lacing around glass . you ca n't miss the sweet smell . the word snappy fits this beer well . it is a winter warmer but not from the usual alcohol burn . the alcohol is almost completely hidden . the warm comes from the mix of cinnamon , hops , and most of all spiciness . the alcohol must be there because i sure did feel it after finishing the glass .

Review:
	on cask locally pours with a lemony yellow body , slightly hazy . think creamy head with fair retention smell , fresh grass and citrus . dry hoppy nose , some background biscuit malt taste , crisp hoppy bite , some citrus notes once again , little bit of malt on the finish followed by a huge whack of dry bittering hops , very refreshing on a hot day it really hit the spot , very drinkable ale , perfect as a session beer due to its low abv

Review:
	a - deep saturated orange gold . very nice appearance . a soapy head which dissipates down quite quickly leaving no trace of any head . no lacing either . light carbonation visible . s - strong ginger and spiced meet honey-like flavors . orange peel spiciness and some mild maltiness . little to no hop aroma . t - ginger and orange flavours dominate an underlying maltiness and very very low hop bitterness m - light and fine carbonation , thin but quite smooth . overly so . d - alot of people are slamming this beer and it is very unconventional , granted but i have tried a few of these fusion , <unk> beers and they have been truly <unk> , this is the best by far . still if your expecting a euro pale larger you will be very upset .

Review:
	a - very nice , clear , dark reddish-amber color . about one finger of somewhat thin head that retains pretty well . leaves pretty nice lacing . s - bready malts matched with some citrus hoppiness t - slightly bitter , citrus hoppiness up front with sweet , bread malt in the finish . nicely balanced . m - fairly light bodied , slightly more watery than i generally like , but i guess i should 've expected this from a 4.4 % brew . d - could definitely be a session beer . nice and refreshing , lower on the abv level , and has a nice balance of flavors .

Review:
	12oz bottle into nonic . opaque brown hue with the exception of some ruby edges at the bottom of the glass . the head is tan and thin ( typical for the style ) , and slowly settles to a bubbly rim . spotty and stringy lacing . roasted malts toppped with some sweet chocolate and a little bit of raisin . the raisin is such a typical scent in this style , it 's a good indicator . the overall smell is similar to a stout . the flavor is very complex , ranging from the bitter malts as a base , along with some creamy chocolate and a very light hop bitterness . some molasses is in there as well . full bodied with a slightly high amount of carbonation , giving a bit of a fizz . the finish is the lingering bitter malts . three words on the label sum this one up pretty well : viscous , chocolatey , roasty . i can add : delicious , complex , recommended .

Review:
	a - this beer poured a golden orange color that produced a fluffy white head that had decent retention and left a moderate amount of lacing on the side of the glass s - the aroma produced by this beer were a little bit of caramel malts followed by a beautiful mix of flowery , citrusy mix of hops t - the taste of this beer , is well , hoppy , but it is a crazy mix that it is kind of hard to pull one variety of hop from another , but it is a bitter blast , just hoped for more coherence m - the mouthfeel of this beer had a resiny , medium body and moderate amount of carbonation d - this beer was , in the words of andy reid , 'an inch away from greatness , ' this could be a great beer , with just a little bit more work

Review:
	a - pours with typical beautiful nitro-cascade , settles out to crisp clear pale gold with 1 1/2 finger lasting fluffy , creamy head , decent lacing . s - very light -- clean and slightly metallic with just a trace of sourdough . t - fairly lager-like , though a bit more full . very mild floral hops , biscuit malts , paper pulp , faint sour green apple , and a bit of metallic flavor . grains make a stronger presence in the finish . perhaps not as complex as it sounds . m - light , too thin , with lots of tiny effervescent carbonation . sometimes i have experienced a lasting and unpleasant bitter metallic aftertaste , but it was n't so prevalent in this tasting for whatever reason d - very mild and easy to drink though the aftertaste can be a bit of a turn off . nothing special really , but not bad by any means . kind of like a dumbed down english pale ... i suspect it has gone this direction intentionally over the last couple of decades .

Review:
	received this beer from csmiley via review this ! bif so a big thank you goes out to him a : this beer pours a beautifully clear deep golden/copper color with a 1/4 inch white head that recedes to a small film quickly . nice wispy lacing is left on the glass s : nose is of pale malts , touch of caramel and citrus hops . t : taste is very well crafted - not overly hopped and malts do not dominate . taste starts with a nice citrus hop flavoring and quickly moves in to a balanced pale malt and finishes with nice sweet caramel malts m : lighter side of medium body , medium carbonation , crisp and clean body . d : well balanced , very tasty and goes down easily . i really wish this brewery distributed this way as i could drink this one all night

Review:
	the beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing . the aroma is good . it appears to have a near perfect malt scent . it 's roasted on one hand . it 's dry and earthy on the other . there 's also a nice chocolate component as well . the taste is good . it has a very nice black malt flavor up front with a big chocolate malt blast and a bit of roasted malt character in the finish . to call it complex is an understatement . the mouthfeel is fine . it is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation . this is a good beer . i 'm not getting a huge roasted character which is standard with export stouts , but this is a delicious beer that 's highly drinkable .

Review:
	this is my old man 's go to beer . i 've had it several times but have never thoroughly thought about what it was i was drinking so i wanted to give it another go . a- pours a light bronze color brew with a one inch finger head that disappeared quickly s- nice malty aroma , nothing too heavy . very little hop note . nothing like other esb 's i 've tried . t- tasting a good blend of caramel and hop bitterness . the hop flavor is the more dominant flavor at the tail . nothing to get real excited about m- malty , light-medium body and very crisp d- very refreshing and clean . this beer would make a great session beer . a very light esb . i will for sure buy this beer again and add it to my round of go-to 's .

Review:
	a much delayed review of this fine sessionable ale from jim at fn . i first had it at redmond 's malt n vine and have subsequently had it at fn headquarters . a low alcohol english bitter is what we have here . sessionable beyond belief . you could go through a growler ( or two ) and still walk the next day . i 'd like to see more breweries attempt session beers like this - as long as they have the flavor of this one .

Review:
	pours opaque black with a soda like fizzy brown head . the nose is a good blend of the beer and the barrel . there 's that oak/vanilla/bourbon combo that we all love , but some roast and raisin actually make it through . nice boozy bourbon flavors , and it keeps the integrity of the beer . the body is a bit thinner than i remember the original being , but its still substantial . seems kind of fizzy though . still , this is a ba beer worth bragging about .

Review:

Review:
	czechvar pours a golden yellow with a fluffy white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle . a mild hoppy aroma is present . taste has some grain and some grass flavors . definitely hoppy as well . definitely different from the american namesake . worth a try , if for no other reason , it 's the original budweiser .

Review:
	wow , quite a beer . i had it in a bomber poured into a lovely stine my brother brought me from austria . it poured a little on the <unk> ' side and the head was so bitter it really pursed my lips . once i got down to the actual beer , it was a difference story . hoppy of course , but now with all the fruit of say a ruination . just a wave of bitterness and a lot of full flavor , almost juicy . but with out the citrus i 'm used to from some ipa 's . i only wish i knew hop varieties well enough to know what is missing . it was nice , but ... .not what i was hoping for . and , well , a bit on the alcoholic <unk> 'm still buzzing an hour later .

Review:
	pours a pale orange with a quickly receding tan head . no lacing is left behind . smells of grass , grain , faint spice and malts . tastes sweet like pumpkin pie and spicy , although you have to reach a bit to get to it , as the tastes are not bold at all , and are actually a little weak . mouth-feel is light bodied and it has medium carbonation . just a little more in the taste department and this could be a very good brew . it feels like shipyard knows what they 're doing here , but they 're just holding something back for some reason . oh well .

Review:
	pours a dark brown color with two fingers of tan head that had good retention . the head eventually settles to a thick cap . just a little spotty lacing is left on the glass . has a complex aroma . i smell chocolate , vanilla , roasted nuts , and some dark fruit . i really enjoyed the flavor of this beer as well . for a beer packing 10 % abv , i did not detect any alcohol aroma or flavor . what i did taste is the nutty malt with some chocolate , vanilla , and a little fruitiness in the finish . i also get some ash or charcoal in the aftertaste . this is a really well put together brown ale . the body is on the lighter side of medium . the carbonation is well suited for the body . the only thing that hurts drinkability is the high abv . i would like to have this again in the future .

Review:

Review:
	i was shocked to find such a wonderful beer in a town where the macros seem to advertise everywhere ; i was surprised that i did not see a neon sign on the high school . but this is one killer beer and made me come back to the firehouse for 3 straight days . it pours a deep dark brown with a slim head , but it produced such beautiful lacing you just can not fault it . the aroma reminded me of a nice think hunk of dark bread dunked in a nice mellow bourbon . having this on the sampler woke me up as everything else while decent , had little character . but once i had it once i could see no reason to order anything else . the flavor was extremely malty with a subtle hoppiness , but the big alcohol punch it packed was what stood up to be noticed . unlike some high alcohol beers this was perfect in flavor and even though you could tell that it was strong , i felt that i needed to drink as many as i could . overall , a damn nice beer that i could really only compare to heavyweight 's <unk> 's hammer , but this might be a little more think and luscious , hard to believe as that is .

Review:
	i slammed this beer before . i think that has alot to do with freshness , as i think this is a solid , tasty everyday beer that does n't always get what it deserves . fruity , <unk> , then sort of thin and floating away in the mouthfeel but addicting , this beer is a museum of the first wave of ipa 's . i think this one still stands up , especially when considered to other examples that just seem sort of boring these days ( however valid that sentiment is ) . try it if you have n't . and throw a six of the fresh stuff in the fridge if you have and show your uneducated beer friends that ipa 's can be simple and not palate assaulting .

Review:
	stately , mature , characterful and slight <unk> this is belgian brewing at its best ! with less tartness than flemish reds or lambics but with a rich depth of character that distinguishes it from the typical belgian doubles and triples . understated yet creamy carbonation allows for a mellow <unk> nearly cask-like . distinct aromas ar of must , peaty earth , lightly horsey and with a cork-like <unk> . rich malt flavors push to the forefront , but foregoing the associates sweetness of caramel or sugar . medium bodied in texture , the mild lemony sourness seems to further lighten the malt-forward ale and usher in a soft lactic dryness . mildly astringent when the woody notes pronounce , but the finish is a marvelous malty-dry yet crisply tart combination that work in harmony a light <unk> flavor reminds me orval except with more body and sweetness . riding on the side saddle with french ales but with the sour <unk> of the senne valley the beer is a new adventure with each sip . masculine and refines but without pretention .

Review:
	served in a pokal at the firkin . what a nice surprise finding this beer here this night . it pours a cloudy , really pale straw topped by nearly two fingers of white froth . the nose comprises smokey charcoal and what seems like a nice bit o ' sweet pineapple . did n't see that coming , i can tell you that . the taste holds notes of peppercorns , light smoke , chipotle peppers , cardamom , light lemon zest , wheat , and a stronger layer of char lining the background . the body is light , with a moderate carbonation and a dry finish . overall , an interesting take on the smoked helles , something i wish i could get more often 'round here .

Review:
	seems to have been bottles mid-february . pours a brown-amber capped with a 1.5-finger ecru head that leaves a good bit of lacing on my glass . the first thing that hits the nose is a grapefruit-y hop aroma . definitely getting buttered popcorn ( diacetyl ) and a little alcohol . i 'm not really liking this aroma , but i guess it 's not all bad . bright , puckering hops hit the palate up front with citrus and accompanying pith . i at first found the label , touting this as malty and robust , to be really misleading , but as this beer warmed some toasty maltiness comes through ; now it 's just misleading . the finish is a dry , <unk> bitterness that lasts well until the next sip . mouthfeel is medium-thin with prickly carbonation . this is n't bad beer , but i certainly wo n't be picking it up again , and would probably hold off on recommending it if there are other options .

Review:
	22oz bottle pouted into a goblet : opaque orange with a light , white , creamy head that was not all that well retained but full of carbonation , but did settle into a small thin cap . the aroma was more belgian triple than ipa , sweet and malty the taste is a very nice balance of the two styles . a little more hops , but balanced very nice with the sweetness of the malt and fruit . the beer had a medium to full body , perhaps a little too thick for my taste , but still good . the beer had a nice bitter dry aftertaste and was well carbonated . the beer was fairly easy to drink give the abv , but after the 22oz , i was pretty well done . overall , a good beer and probably the first one of the side projects that i think the brewery should consider brewing on a regular basis .

Review:
	12 oz bottle poured into pint glass . appearance : hazy dark amber color with a thin off-white head . smell : a great combination of bready , caramel malts and grassy , citrus hops . neither seems to overpower . taste : this is where the hops take over . a pungent hop punch hit you immediately surrounded perfectly by a fruity malt character . some apples and maybe honey ( ? ) are present . very complex taste . finishes very clean with only a slight pleasant bitterness . mouthfeel : full-bodied goodness . the dueling hops and malt feel good . drinkability : this could be a dangerous beer . it hides the abv well with a clean finish . the big malt backbone may make this more difficult to drink for some .

	the first careful pour from a long-standing bottle delivers a crystal-clear golden-orange and yellow body that teems with fine , effervescent bubbles beneath a two inch head of densely creamy white froth . the head retention is excellent and it maintains a solid quarter inch of cream as well as leaving almost completely solid walls of lace throughout the glass . the nose delivers a sweetish , candy laced malt that 's brightened with a touch of orange , melon , and perhaps vanilla amidst a sprinkling of coriander . in the mouth its tiny bubbles foam-up on the tongue , giving a little tingle before it becomes pillowy soft and lightly creamy . the flavor expresses what the nose suggests , but with more <unk> . it 's vanilla is much clearer than the nose suggests , and its delicately citrusy orange character balances the candy and vanilla alongside a sublime spiciness of coriander and white pepper . its bitterness is well heeled ; and it 's superbly balanced for the style - particularily given it 's 9 % alcohol which never fully shows ! an astounding beer that 's rich without being bold enough to hinder its drinkability , and complex enough to remain interesting throughout several glasses . additionally , this is well worth stocking up on as it should appeal to a wide variety of guests in your home , and works equally well during a cool summer evening on the back porch as it does during the holiday season

Review:
	on tap at <unk> in a plastic cup appearance : amber with a tan one finger head that lingers ; decent lacing smell : malty , bready ; some spiciness taste : very smooth , malts come through with an almost sweet finish . light hops mouthfeel : medium , really coats the tongue overall : i was never too excited about this one from a bottle . but on tap , the freshness really comes through . smooth , yet robust . a nice fall beer . a really solid seller at the beer garden i was pouring at .

Review:
	auburn-tinted amber under a surprisingly heathly rise of buttercreme <unk> nose of vodka , cherry juice , dark rum , bourbon , biscuits , and caramel into the mouth , it begins with a dripping caramel and black liquorice hues . and for a moment , this could well be mead , full of honey and sweet alcohol . it gathers thickness , as well as gummi sweet & sour cherry notes . it lingers here a while , sagging under its own girth , with the cherry and oak chip glinting sourness barely offsetting the maple syrup and brown sugar cloy . it rides out with a minced date , apicot , cherry , and blood orange fruitness , still dappled in caramel and cooked sugars . boil all this into a spiced rum bath heavy , obese , bodied . to say that this drinks like mrs butterworth is no hyperbole , nor is it libel . honestly , this is probably best served poured unto pancakes that said , it can be tackled in successive sips , and thus distances itself from avery 's other high proof ventures . diabetics and other <unk> people beware .

Review:
	-- -- 2003 vintage -- - i am a pretty big fan of samichlaus , although it definitely is n't my favorite . however , i recently tried a 7 year old bottle , and i realized how wonderfully it can age . the appearance was a great , thick looking dark brown . it almost seemed to pour like it was caramel . the taste fit in with the caramel description . it was thick , malty , and delicous . i am glad there are n't too many 7 year old <unk> ' around , or this would be a dangerous beer . i was dreading the end of the glass

Review:
	22 ounce bottle . pours hazy amber color with a nice 2 finger white head with very good retention that reduces to a lacing cap that leaves nice lacing . aromas of caramel , citrus , grapefruit , floral , and pine . taste of strong grapefruit , with caramel , spice , and pine . finishes off with a nice clean bitterness and lingering citrus and fruit flavor . definitely one of the best balanced ipa 's i have come across . very smooth drinking . a little bit of alcohol warming on the finish . medium body and carbonation . this is phenomenal , will definitely buy again .

Review:
	surprisingly there was some of this still around 2 days after the 2 brothers event at blind tiger , lucky me . a- dark coppery brown barely able to peak through . very little head , just a splotch of some micro bubbles bunched together in the middle with a thin ring around the glass s-light malty with a touch of sugary red wine . pretty sweet . t- starts off with the sweetness i anticipated , but never really peaks- luckily . there is a sustained maltiness with a touch of red <unk> in there . i really enjoy the nutty notes in there , with the sweetness it gives me some brittle like flavors <unk> m- light- med bodied with a little viscosity . no carbonation goin on here d- tasty beer , a little on the sweet side . i would not have guessed it was oak aged . i like the nuttiness . reminds me of a sweet nut brown ale .

Review:
	appearance : the pour produces a dark tan , .5 ' head that gradually recedes back into the liquid from which it came , save for a ring around the glass and a small island of froth . the beer is practically black in color , save for some brown light escaping from the edges . smell : dominant roasted , hazelnut , woody aromas . definately a considerable aroma of bourbon barrel , with some light vanilla accompanying . somewhat sharp alcohol sting , but not as bad in my opinion as others have mentioned . maybe some age mellowed it out . moderately sweet , with a dark chocolate aroma . a milder ris aroma , but nice . low to moderate hop aroma . mouthfeel : the carbonation is on the light side of the medium range , and the body is just above medium . taste : semisweet chocolate , roasted barley , oak , and some nuttiness up front . just the slightest alcohol tinge . finish astringent with just a little hop aroma . drinkability : easy purchased from the caboose in va with dirtylou on the way back from our dogfish excursion last summer ... cellared since then .

Review:
	thanks to wnoble for the chance to try this . 22 oz . bomber into a duvel tulip . poured a opaque black with a generous three-finger mocha head which settled to a coating . lacing was almost non-existent as it warmed . nose was pine and floral hops , some chocolate , and a little roasted grain . taste was awesome - <unk> but hop-forward . like most things i enjoy , there was an interesting interplay , in this case between the sweetness of the malt ( chocolate and toasted grain ) and the great hop prescence - tropical fruits , bitterness , etc . there were some spice notes as well . mouthfeel was medium with moderate carbonation . all-in-all , this was a very nice offering i would have again - if i only could ...

Review:
	poured from a 375 ml bottle a : poured a deep golden color , most comparable to tree sap . very little head , but permanent lacing s : definitely sourness straightforward . when you smell it , it has that piercing sourness that hits you in the jowls , also kinda dusty if that makes sense t : a very citrusy type of sourness , almost like a lemon balm , also has deep earthy characteristics f : very tingly and smooth . very good carbonation , and again , hits you in the jowls on the finish overall , i really like this one . ca n't say i 've ever had a bad rr beer though . if you like wild ales and sours , this is the top one i would recommend . it was a very , , very complex beer though , so i will be revisiting it soon . cheers , russian river

Review:
	appearance : light amber color , thick head with nice lacing . smell : strong malt aroma with slight alcohol followed . taste : mild malt sweetness , then nice hop bitterness , alcoholic at the finish . mouthfeel/drink : medium bodied , smooth to drink , but not impressed . the brewery say they use very old ice age melting water coming from scandinavia . i can not tell the difference between glacier water and normal water , just a selling point i think .

Review:

Review:
	this brew is a clear , almost cherry red colour with nothing for head . okay , a thin white head formed on an aggressive pour , but it was gone before i could sit down . the smell is somewhat sweet , bready and floral . a fairly strong aroma , and not unpleasant . the taste is much like the smell up front , but its finish is a bit of a mystery to me . there is a fair burst of flavour over the back of the tongue . it makes me think of black licorice , but that is n't exactly it . i 'll have to read through some of the other reviews to see if anyone pinned it down . anyway , i find the flavour is about average , it is n't greatly pleasing to me , but not offensive either . mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side , and the beer is fizzy , not very comfortable to leave on the tongue for too long . not a bad beer really , but not something i 'll be looking for on shopping trips .

Review:
	750 ml bottle served slightly chilled in a delirium noel glass . appearance : clear brown with ruby overtones topped by a nice healthy beige head . streamers of bubbles keep the head pretty decently replenished and assist in leaving decent amounts of lace on the sides of the glass . smell : strong spicy clove aromas dominate , with some light pepper , bubblegum , yeast , and banana scents kicking around . taste : clovey and peppery with some nice caramel malt and candi sugar sweetness to balance it all out . not overly complex . mouthfeel : great carbonation on a medium bodied beer . relatively crisp . drinkability : pretty decent , but there are definitely better beers out there in this style : maudite , trois pistoles , and la terrible to name a few .

Review:
	presentation : it was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a pint glass . appearance : the head is has a slightly off white color and it builds up thick and foamy . it slowly fades down to a wispy thin layer that just hangs on until the end . there is very little lacing to speak of . the body has a light golden amber color with very good clarity . smell : its aroma is light and has a sweet grainy character with a very mild hop presence . taste/mouth feel : the flavor has a simple light grain and mild sweetness with a good balance of earthy and floaral hops . the texture is smooth and slightly slick with mild carbonation . its body is about medium . notes : overall i feel that it is a rather boring marzen .

Review:

Review:
	( 500 ml bottle ) . typical hefe cloudy golden , large head . lovely strong aroma of ripe bananas , bubblegum and cloves . cloves in the flavour too , light bodied , tasty but could still use some more 'bite ' . like most weissbiers not too much aftertaste . good , not outstanding . rerate : this is a beer i come back to all the time , as it is relatively cheap in norway ( available at vinmonopolet ) and very refreshing . not a great beer if you are looking for the big flavours , though .

Review:
	12oz bottle , no dating . brewed by elevator in columbus . pours a darker golden color with a fizzy white head and soapy lacing which hangs around for the duration of the drink . smell is slightly off-putting ; the malt comes off a bit musty and plastic-like . that same plastic-like note is in the flavor as well . grassy , vegetal notes come through along with some sweetness from the malt , but the plasticity is tough to overcome . nice body , particularly for the style , so no complaints there . quite simply , the recipe needs to be tweaked . hopefully it 's just a bad batch , because all the other elements are there for a solid pale lager .

Review:
	bottle courtesy of seeswo . 2010 vintage served in my old stock snifter . pours a translucent mahogany with a loose , half-inch off-white head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders , forming a thin , bubbly band . there 's also a residual oily slick across the center of the glass . nose expresses milk chocolate , a trace of dark fruit and a pleasant buttery vanilla character . only the merest suggestion of bourbon presents itself . taste expresses toffee , butter candied fruit and a slightly acrid ethanol character that lingers at the back . mouthfeel is medium-light ( but closer to light ) with a slightly coarse carbonation and quite a bit of residual heat that lingers on the tongue and at the back of the throat . all and all , a pretty good barleywine that could use some time to allow that alcohol presence to dissipate . that said , if the alcohol does in fact dissipate , the thinness to the body would be more prominent . i 'm not sure if a lot of age will improve this beer , but another year in the cellar might reveal a decent balance .

Review:
	pours a very hazy orange golden with a thin head that settles to a ring . smells of lemon and some slightly sweet malt , with a touch of light , earthy bitterness . lacks some of the exuberant yeastiness of the style , but not bad . light yeast , very light spiciness with just the barest wisp of clove , slight tang on the finish . smooth and light rather than crisp in the mouth , not quite a zingy and flavorful and quenching as i like my hefes .

Review:
	nicely dark body for this style , its a deep brown with hints of amber on the sides . hosts a 2 finger head that is a rich tan that leaves nice lace as it fades . super hoppy nose yields a late season ripe citrus feel with nice balance . rich and bitter mingle together as you indulge into this one at first sip . hops come off soft and long but well presented . bitterness is balanced with a slight malt character . a shockingly bold belly warmer for the style , <unk> more like an impy stout . mouthfeel is a hop induced malt mix richness . very well made lovely brew for the season . i wish i could find this beer and many others from these guys in indiana .

	12 oz bottle pours a clear , light copper color with a tall , light tan head . fades slow and leaves lots of sticky lace . very nice looking beer . nose is a very nice blend of hop aromas . tropical and minty with a bit of alcohol backdrop . malts are pretty light , as the appearance would suggest , lending a biscuity aspect . this one is all about the hop flavors . bitterness builds from low to high and the lighter , grainier malt backbone lets the multitude of tropical hop flavors to come forth . abv is hidden well and the body is nice and creamy . i think this is the best beer saint arnold has ever made . i actually think it could at least hang with some of the better cali ipas/iipas .

Review:
	the bottle looks like a small wine-bottle , brown 33 cl longnecked . the small label at the bottom is yellow and has got a picture of s : t erik ( or erik <unk> , a swedish king from the mid 12th century ) . a : pours pale golden with an airy white , kind of fluffy head . slow dissipation leaves quite nice lacings s : lots of american hops , piney and citric - there are both grapefruit as well as pineapple . but besides the nice-smelling hops i ca n't smell anything else t : the taste is better balanced than the smell - there 's everything from the smell , but in combination with a slight roasted maltyness m : aftertaste is short , but holds both some sweetness but also bitterness . body is kind of weak and carbonation is medium . d : not a bad beer , but there are lots of other <unk> ' i rather drink . the good thing about this one is the bold hoppyness . but if you are n't into hops this one would do nothing for you .

	this pours a very cloudy lemon colour . some retention of head . not a pretty beer . lots of banana on the nose . a little bit of spice as well . the banana continues on the palate . some sweetness is evident . medium bodied with a high level of carbonation . very refreshing on a hot day .

Review:
	received a 4 pack ( nicely aged , i might add ) from a friend . poured into the snifter well and has a nice golden appearance , with a nice light head . a bit hazy , almost like a <unk> type beer . general aroma was nice and fruity . i was excited to sit and watch the thunder storm roll in whilst enjoying this beer . drank it slightly chilled , but not cold , to savour the true flavours ... .which were nice and robust . the taste is very good , and not overpowering like some in its style class , but still enough flavour so you take notice . definately becoming a favourite of mine . will need to get my hands on more for sure . not a food beer , but better after dinner sitting with friends on the porch .

Review:
	i was in new zealand for an entire month , and on arrival i was quite looking forward to the beers of a former british holding . i was sorely disappointed almost the entire time i was there -- most beers tended to be sweet , thick , and malty like american malt liquor without the high abv that justifies them . until i met sassy red ... a : actually , sassy red is n't all that red , sort of amber with a suntan . s : the smell is the best part -- it 's biscuity and toasty with some nut oil -- brazil nut and almond - in there , all carried out with popping hoppiness right on the front of the nose . t : unlike most amber/reds with toasty notes in the nose , sassy red actually carried those comforting flavors in to the taste . the only reason that this rating does n't exceed a four is because the beer is marketed as a bitter , but in fact its not as bitter as it might be . it is more hoppy than bitter -- more vegetal than a bitter might normally express . m : thinner than it could be , and carries just a little too much carbonation for its type of flavor , but still very pleasant and slick . d : it must be drinkable -- i had about 8 in the auckland airport while my flight was delayed . this is a beer i want as my first and my last of the night -- something i can say about few others . it is flavorful enough to get me going and keep me interested , but not in any way cloying or too heavy . i already miss sassy red and i just got back .

Review:
	hard to find - mostly a northern midwest beer hence the name . pour was avg . typical lager . this beer has a little more flavor and bite than most lagers . somewhat creamy and malty it went down easy - a bit pricey but a good change of pace from typical american lagers yes - some of us enjoy good ol ' american brew .

Review:
	cloudy yellow in color w/ a thick head that is n't quite as well retained compared to other hefeweizens . tart wheat notes w/ mild banana & bubblegum yeast esters in aroma . the aroma is n't as complex as other examples of the style , and is akin to a more tart , but less estery paulaner aroma . flavorwise , yeast contributions are subdued for style , but musty and light banana flavors are present . grainy , tart wheat flavors assert themselves since they 're not overpowered by yeast esters . the finish consists of residual sweetness and a hint of a grainy note . like other pinkus brews , it 's stylistically odd , but flavorful enough to warrant a taste .

Review:
	poured on-tap at the cigar city brewing tasting room in tampa . served in a pint glass , the beer pours a dark brown coloring with a thin layer of off-white head . smells are slightly hoppy and citrusy . the beer 's flavors are wet hops and grapefruit initially , with a tangy , sweet caramel and chocolate blend at the end . flavors are similar to a red ipa . slightly boozey and slick consistency , with an astringent and drying finish .

Review:
	a- pours a cloudy and hazy orange-amber hue with a nice amount off craggy white head that is sustaining and leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass s- aroma is mostly citrus and floral hops along with yeasty wheat malts t- hmmmm , initial taste is of wheat and sweet malts , followed by bread malts and dark citrus in the middle , and finishing with an unassuming touch of dry hops and alcohol m- medium-bodied hefe with an almost oily texture , light carbonation d- at 7.5 % abv , this is definitely on the <unk> for a hefe , fairly drinkable overall , but lacks any unique characteristics for a repeat buy . i think the biggest knock on this beer is that it tries to be both an ipa and a hefe but fails at both , sometimes <unk> ' are not the best picks for beers and this shines with this 'imperial hefeweizen ' . if i want a good ipa , there are plenty of better choices , and the same holds for hefes , i see no situation in which i would want the hoppiness of an ipa with the <unk> maltness of a hefe . but props to pyramid for trying something new

Review:
	i had this out of a 12 oz brown bottle and served in a british imperial pint glass . enjoy by date clearly marked for april 26 2005 . this beer is a freshy . the aroma on this beer is phenomenal . strong whiffs of citrus fruit ( grapefruits , oranges , and limes ) and balsam fur pine . clearish yellow , light orange color . nice sticky lacings cling and stay all over the glass medium bodied with a really smooth mouthful . again , pine and citrus are blending together to create a sweet and bitter combo . sweet and crisp with a major hop bite . incredibly drinkable at 8.5 % abv . this beer is a treat and one of the best double ipa 's i 've had i 'm so glad this beer just began working its way into boston . this is one masterpiece of an ipa .

Review:
	a testament to aging quality ales , only to be served in a red wine glass or tulip . a : hazy shade of bronze , a smallish off-white head with tears of hops and malts abounding . s : wonderful balance as the hops have mellowed out enough to let the malts shine through the forest for all the trees . aromas of pine , caramel , grapefruit , pineapple and charred walnuts . t : as it warms up , the flavors suggested by the scents begin to emerge . another year may merge the two perfectly . m : medium to full-bodied , a old guardian aged some 1.5 years is viscous and luscious d : some claim to be able to drink more than one of these 22oz bombers . ok , but if you 're willing to split the second one among three or four , i 'd be happy to savor this night cap a case of this is well worth procuring . a few during the infant years , a few right about now and the rest over time . to my mind , a beer cellar needs old guardian keeping the treasure safe .

Review:
	the appearance was nice . dark gold with not much of a head but nice lacing when it started to dissipate . the smell was ever so hoppy with a hint of the grapefruit flavor that 's contained within . the taste was interesting , up front tart grapefruit , not sweet in the least . more like grapefruit rind even . slight hint of hops and seemingly no malt . the mouth feel was crisp , with some biting carbonation . drinkability was easily above average due to the crispness and lack of sweetness . not the usual taste you expect when drinking a fruit beer . in fact this is my favorite fruit beer ever .

Review:
	the beige head is comprised of medium-sized bubbles and slowly , but inevitably , recedes to a thin strip ; there is some lacing adhering to the glass . black malt ( i think ) lends the beer a not pleasantly bitter and toasted flavour . i could n't detect chocolate . beck 's dark is a bit watery on the palate and has a bitter finish i ca n't complain too much about beck 's dark but i ca n't rave too much about it , either .

Review:
	a : poured a nice dark brown with a tan colored head about half an inch thick , nice red/garnet accents when held to the light . little clumps of lacing all around the glass , not too shabby . not terribly impressive though s : smells like a more guinness-y guinness really , there are some roasted malts there , signature guinness smells , less burnt though , a little bit of chocolate , and i ca n't help but notice a distinct smell of <unk> water ? glass was clean too ... hmmmm . slightly sour guinness smell as well t : pretty nice on the chocolate , not too much initially for the roasted/burnt flavor , still it is there , a nice black coffee flavor , not strong coffee , but just coffee . definitely a hop presence in this one that is n't in the draught guinness . clean and earthy , piney . not too bad . slight earthy aftertaste m : relatively thick , it is n't an export stout or imperial stout , but still is pretty hefty in the mouth , very smooth , not much carbonation . not too shabby d : not quite as drinkable as the draught , but still not too bad . i could easily see drinking a few of these .

Review:
	i got the sampler tray at the snipes brewpub/restaurant in sunnyside , wa . sample size was approximately 4 ounces . a- golden clear color and generous head in spite of the little sampler glass size . s- strong florals and citrus from being dry-hopped , i presume . any aroma from the malts was hidden . t- i would liken this brew to a dry hopped version of their pale ale . flavor palate was dominated by the hops , which came through as floral and citrus . malts were over-dominated . m- thin , medium to light body . bitterness lingers as would be expected . alcohol is hidden . d- decent ipa-like beer . the dry hopping adds a nice floral aroma and flavor . interesting brew and worthy of a try .

Review:
	taste gets better as it warms . i 'm not the kind who can pick out every individual yeast ester and give you a real world counterpart . i can tell you that this beer reminds me of a very good esb . this very much tastes like fuller 's esb . not one of those hopped up ambers . the biscuity malt . the fruit flavors . all of that . some differences , i assume . but i would need to have a fuller 's and this side by side to point them out to you . beautiful amber color with nice head . head goes down . but a nice lacing stays for a while . taste lingers . makes you crave more .

Review:
	my expectations for an abbey ale from new belgium were not high . but since brewers and breweries evolve , i thought i should give this a try pours clear orange/copper with a modest tan head that dissipates to a fine ring of bubbles around the glass , with some lacing . aromas of wet hay , some fruit ( orange ) , and some hops way in the background . taste follows the nose with sweet malt , orange , lemon , a hint of milk chocolate , then a dry hoppy and somewhat spicy finish . overall , this is tasting to me like a dubbel light body is light , with good carbonation , it has a moderately creamy mouthfeel this is a drinkable dubbel style beer , but is lighter in substance than most abbey dubbels . at only 7 % abv , it is more drinkable and also more affordable than most belgian abbey doubles . might serve as a good introduction to the style for those who are experimenting in that direction .

Review:
	i hate to be the guy who disses a top rated brew , but i guess today i am that guy . maybe i 'm just sick of beers like this , but i feel like once you 've had one <unk> stout you 've had 'em all . the coffee and chocolate flavors are too much for beer , or too at least too much for this beer . i love a nice stout that has a more subtle coffee or chocolaty flavor that 's imparted by the kind of malt they used , but this straight up infused flavor is too syrupy for me in general . do n't get me wrong , it is delicious , it 's just not something i like in my beer i 've decided appears a dark pitch brown color , a wimpy head that dissapears quickly . smells extremely roasty and sweet , but with a ton of nice bitterness in the form of coffee and bitter chocolate . maybe even from the hops but i ca n't really detect any . taste could be full of complex flavors , and the potential is there , but the palate is really overrun with the intense coffee bean chocolate party that 's going on in this beer . i 've already talked about that part ... the real saving grace of this beer is the mouthfeel . soft and pillowy , it 's so smooth and just velvety on the palate with a slight chewyness . if i had no tastebuds even i would drink this just for the texture . to finish up , it could just be me or a stylistic sort of preference thing , but the strong coffee flavors do n't work for this beer i hate to say . check out the black rye from founders , there 's a killer beer for ya .

Review:
	tried this at a thai place that was out of tsingtao . not a bad beer . i think i preferred this greatly over asahi . pours a hugely carbonated pale yellow that is transparent . nothing really exciting about it . not a lot of nose , a little citrus but mostly a clean aroma ( probably because of the rice ) tasted good and clean , a little sweet and a little citrus . very refreshing , especially when drank with a sticky hot thai dish ( i had this with my shrimp coconut soup and red curried duck ) lots of fizz in the mouth from the extreme carbonation . i kind of liked it very drinkable , i could have had several but since we were just out for dinner i had to settle for two .

Review:
	on tap at rr in santa rosa . poured in a short glass to a cloudy <unk> with medium thick off-white head that lingers well and leaves okay lacing . nose is sour red fruit and hops , mouthfeel thick and tangy-sweet and the taste a <unk> follow to the scents in the nose , with some alcohol added in at mid-glass . like a good flemish sour , the finish was long and a rush of tangy fruit , quickly followed by a warming sugar sweetness . not quite the duchesse , but a damn good sour .

Review:
	a- pours a mid-golden with a short lived small fizzy white head . got a few streams of carbonation floating upward . no lacing , below average head retention . s- smells of sweet malt . t- follows the nose . had to ponder what it tastes like because it was distinct although unknown to me ... have to agree with the two reviewers below me , green apple and cheerios . what an odd combo ... but somehow it works , kinda . m- full , <unk> for the style . d/o- nothing to write home about but could be a lot worse . per the style i 'd have to say it 's middle of the pack .

Review:
	poured from the 12-ounce bottle into a pint glass at room temperature this brew shows a hazy carmel color with an out of control oatmeal colored head and layers of lacing . the aroma is a really nice sweet malt and herbal hops . very thick smell with an edible quality that also notes thick brown bread and apple . the taste is a nice medium bodied tartness with some dry hops blended with caramel malt . pretty chewy stuff for an ipa , almost a mild dipa with some alcohol noted . midland drinkable , definitely worth a try but just short of spectacular .

Review:
	poured from a 14.9 oz nitro can in to an imperial pint glass . pours a very clear , light tea color with a a beautiful big nitro head . very little smell . light hop smell with even less malt . creamy taste ( aided by thick head ) with buttery , biscuity taste that is stronger than the original smell . slight bitterness in the aftertaste . mouthfeel is great due to the nitro head . very drinkable session beer that has minimal flavor for a somewhat quality beer . nice to have around .

Review:
	a very dark brown beer with a small head , that forms a small off-white layer on the side of the glass . smell is coffee , strong sweet chocolate and above all black malt , like the grains smell . some vanilla to smooth the roast taste is mildly roasted with a heavy chocolate taste , which makes a sweet impression . i get hints of cacoa , vanilla , en cappucino . the beer 's body is just right for this kind of beer . some sweetnes , but not too sticky . bitterness is low and the beer is nicely balanced .

Review:
	this beer poured a hypnotically deep amber color almost as though it wanted to be an american brown . near white head that faded quickly way darker than i was expecting . hops nose but not nearly as aggressive as most ipas . so far not what i think of an ipa . the taste is malty at the very beginning then followed by a punch of hops that hits you right in the back of the jaw . exactly what it should be . the finish is especially bitter and hoppy . the mouthfeel is good ; moderate carbonation and smooth . poignant and bitter in a notable way . a strange ipa but an outstanding one .

Review:
	a : held up to the florida sun , there is n't a shimmer of light shinning threw this chocolate stout . on top of the black liquid goodness sits a milk chocolate head that happens to be the same color as the label on the bottle . s : just as i expected , choklat is the most chocolate smelling beer in the beer world . southern tier always impresses me with these kind of brews , but the lack of complexity is it 's only downfall . t : this brew reminds me of when i was a kid and used to put chocolate syrup on top of chocolate fudge that was on top of chocolate ice cream that was being eaten out of a chocolate cone ( with chocolate sprinkles of course ) . the fact that they managed to brew this stout at 11 % without affecting the flavor is amazing . mf : mouthfeel is like creamy milk chocolate ... .just they way it should be . d : drinkability is excellent . southern tier has some issues in this category for me because some of their brews are just too over the top ( see creme brulee ) , but who does n't love chocolate ( especially with a well hidden abv )

Review:
	this beer poured a very appealling copper reddish color . it was very clear with an average head . i could immediately smell a sweet aroma , but did not immediately pick up on the currant . the first taste was just some sweetness , but then after a bit ( and after eating some mild cheese ) , the total fruitiness of the currant started to appear . it was a bit slow to develop , but then all of a sudden i could really taste it . the aroma also developed and the fruit was definitely present . i am not sure how much was the cheese acting as a palate neutralizer or simply that as it warmed the fruit came through . the beer just got better as i continued to enjoy it . of course , when tasting , eating food is not always advised , however , i will definitely say mild cheeses had no ill effect , but do not serve this beer to anyone while they are eating anything spicy or they will really miss out on its beauty .

Review:
	pours a very dark brown but shows a lot of red color when held to the light , a surprising amount of which makes shows through . head is tan , creamy , a little over an inch , and both lasts and laces the glass well aroma is a tad lighter than the best examples , but sticking ones nose in reveals ample toasted malt covered with a chocolate , an herbal hop , no alcohol or diacetyl . flavor is quite good , full , sweet , balanced by a substantial bitterness - both from hops and a little from charred malt - which builds on the palate . a mild astringency is keeping it from an elite score . the char shows up much more in the flavor than aroma . body is barely medium but creamy , carbonation soft - more would be too much with the bitterness/astringency of the hop/malt bill . all in all it is a solid porter that i 'd have again . seems to be somewhere between the brown and robust styles

Review:
	this beer tastes very smooth and is quite easy to drink . reminds me of <unk> esb , but so much stronger ! i 'm glad i got this as a single in a mixed mystery bag , or i 'd be in trouble . appearance - cloudy orange , not much of a head . no head after settling . smell - bready taste - yeasty , caramel , a little sweet , strong tang ( from alchoholic content , i imagine ) mouthfeel - heavy , smooth -- not much carbonation drinkability - very drinkable . scarily so

Review:
	poured froma 12 oz bottle into a sam adams glass ( hey , it was in reach ) . poured clean with a nice deep golden straw color with over 2 fingers of crisp head that quickly sunk down . impressive lacing on the glass , with legs aroma was full of grassy hops and caramel , with some alcohol presence on the nose . taste was extremely grassy with very little malt character at all , and extremely boozy . seems like they let this one ferment a bit too long . if they used a bit more malts and stopped fermentation to yield the same 8.5 % , this would be a far better beer . this beer is way too boozy for 8.5 % . dogfish head 's 120 minute tastes and smells less boozy , and that weighs in at 20 % mouthfeel is thin , dry , and bubbly . as a result , drinkability was not good . i had to switch off with water every so often , and looked for something to munch on to break the boozy grassy flavor from layering too thickly on my tongue . overall , this beer looks fantastic but just does n't live up to the quality expected in a iipa ; other breweries have set the bar fairly high with strong but balanced iipas . this one is just way too boozy and grassy to be enjoyable .

Review:
	on tap at st . james infirmary this is a killer amber ale . it 's very strong and it 's very hoppy , but lagunitas is king at hoppy beers . there is always a solid balance for the huge amount of hops . so people who do n't consider themselves a fan of hops can still enjoy this beer , most likely . it 's weird that they call this a 'red ale , ' when it is clearly an amber color . other amber ales are far more red than this . check out the .alt version of this one too

Review:
	i feel a little bad being the one to add this beer , since it 's far from my favorite style and i did n't like it very much . pours a slightly hazy golden color without much head . aroma is almost completely herbal - anise , lavender , clove , a touch of honey . palate is a little more balanced by pale ( pilsner ? ) malt , but still is huge on the herbal notes . finish is a little chalky and has a distinct bitter herb that i can isolate but am unable to actually identify . this is a light , easy drinking ale , but it 's kind of an experiment . not my bag , but i appreciate the effort to make an obscure style .

Review:
	550ml bottle split with my brew buddy jared . a : not jet black but a couple of shades lighter . dark tan head , excellent retention and beautiful lacing . s : mildly sweet with a fair amount of chocolate and a hint of coffee . quite a bit of roast is present as well , along with a light earthy hop character . sweet oatmeal is present in the back . t : very well balanced , this beer opens with the roasted malt and the mild cocoa and coffee and oatmeal sweetness in perfect harmony . this beer is medium bodied , big enough to hold the flavors together while light enough to be truly refreshing . mildly bitter on the finish with flavors of oatmeal , chocolate and raisins lingering , this is smooth on the palate with light carbonation . a touch metallic on the finish ( iron ? ) , this is the only flaw i can point to here . the oatmeal does take the edge off the roasted malt bitterness . i could drink an awful lot of this .

Review:
	dark black with nearly no light at all shining through on this one . rich tan colored head of about two inches quickly settled down to about a half inch of tan that thoroughly coated the inside of the glass . this was what the style is all about the aroma was just loaded down with coffee . rich notes of mocha mixes in with a rich , and sweet coffee note . a tiny bit of bitterness and an earthy flare lying down underneath of it , but the majority of this one was hands down , rich brewed coffee . the flavor was more of the same . rich notes just rolled over the tongue in waves and thoroughly coated the inside of the mouth . sweet with touches of chocolate and vanilla to highlight the coffee notes ,

Review:
	i 'm back on the air for the first time since katrina here , and thought it would be appropriate to start up again with a hometown brew ( though these days i 'm based in houston , sigh ) . i stopped by the abita brewpub on a visit to nola this weekend , and had a couple of pints of the pecan ale . i picked up a growler and babied it back to houston ( put it on ice in a cooler ) , and it seems to have made it back unscathed . color is a nice deep copper , and the tan head is ample even when it 's served a little on the cold side , as is the pint in front of me . even cold , though , the malty nose is prominent and enjoyable . carbonation is very active on the tongue , and while i generally prefer my brown ales a little more sedate in this respect , you could argue that this keeps it from being syrupy . taste is all smooth malt , edging onto sweet . very rich . the pecan presence is most noticeable in the finish , with a crisp , dry flavor precisely like fresh pecans . very southern , very lovely -- brews like this make me believe ever more deeply in drinking local . call it 'beer terroir ' . this is one of abita 's select series , meaning it 's only available on tap -- and only at their brewpub , in my experience , and only when they feel like brewing up a batch . this is one of the better abitas i 've had , and it would make the trek to the north shore more than worthwhile . bring ya growler

Review:
	this beer poured out as a nice golden color with a white head on top . the head retention was pretty good on this brew . i found the smell of the beer to have a nice aroma of caramel and some light hops on the nose . the taste of the beer was really nicely done i thought . the flavors of sweet malts and the bitter finish worked well together . the mouthfeel was very drinkable and could <unk> have serval back to back . overall this brew is pretty good and i would n't <unk> drinking it again one day .

Review:
	poured from a bottle into a duvel tulip a- pours a dark shade of amber with a three finger slightly offwhite head . the head is very puffy , and the lacing is all the way around the glass 4.5 s- earthy hops , but they smell absolutely wonderful and strong . getting some hints of cat piss as well ... simcoe up in here ? 4 t- wow , the bitterness is strong in this one . lots of pine up front , and the finish is slightly sweet . very solid 4 m- it has a real nice body to it , nice and thick . not chewy like a stout , but it has that nice ipa backbone to it o- really like this beer . tastes a lot like torpedo , but a little less abrasive and fresher . plus , at 4.79 for a bomber , it was a steal 5

Review:
	a - clear amber body with a large foamy offwhite head . s - a big bouquet of raspberries and blueberries . fresh , sweet , tangy fruit aromas . floral hop notes . t - tangy fruit with a buttery back note . sweet splash of soft fruit liquor and tangy hops . fruit-like acidity , akin to apple skin . blueberry and dark fruit present here . tangy starches and spiced alcohol bring depth to this beers flavors . m - warming , drying medium body . clean on the palate and the carbonation buzzes the tongue . o - plenty of fruit in the nose and mouth . the starchy , buttery flavors add a different dimension here .

Review:
	a clear light amber to dark gold colored ale . good tall white head forms and then falls some but does n't disappear . the smell is sweet with a little musty and earth scent like mushrooms . little bit of butter mixes in with the malt aroma , which is mostly biscuit . little bit of wood and leather is also present in the scent . slight tea , tobacco and wood aroma from the english hops used . the taste begins sweet and malty with a stouter than anticipated bitterness . this has a strong pipe tobacco flavor to it that is different and rather nice . this is a nice ale but it could be a little stronger it just seems to mellow out a little too much after a while . the mouthfeel is good . a pricey yet good ale without too much of the butter flavor that you come to expect from a wychwood beer and ringwood yeast strains . worth a try for sure but i ca n't really see reaching for this beer again because of the cost . for less money i will be reaching for the lagunitas and firestone beers for normal consumption .

Review:
	sort of an deeper honey color with a white fluffy head . aromas of grapefruit tempered by earthy malt . the flavor is much the same , with the addition of a super sweet <unk> taste that also provides a rich and somewhat sticky body . i went in kinda fast , but wound up sipping and savoring modestly at the end . very strong brew that masks itself well , though this is in the neutral zone of american dipa and barley wine .

Review:
	served from a plain-looking , yellow labled 750 , this tripel pours out bright , lightly clouded apricot yellow with a <unk> dense and chunky white head that has epic retention and tons of stick aroma is so much bigger than i expected from a tripel that ( only ) registers at 6.8 % . big , tropical and orchard fruit with funky , yeasty spice and a pepper/coriander bite . green apple and pear is shadowed by honeyish , pilsneresque malts , and complex , phenolic undertones featuring banana and buttery croissant . flavor registers equally high in my book . so surprising becuase it is relatively low abv % compared to the highest rated tripels . a complex malt and fruit entry is kicked up by creamy-sweet lemon curd , grated key lime peel , freshly baked pie crust , grahm cracker , and fluffy cotton candy . the finish is well-hopped with soft nuances of white pepper infused green herbs and saazy earthyness . complex and dry , excellent .

Review:
	a : a 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass yields a brown ale with ruby hues and a 1/2 inch fluffy khaki/tan head . chunks of lacing cling to the side of the glass as i drink my way down -- certainly looks nice s : sweet malty scents dominate -- caramel malt , hazelnut , some chocolate and brown sugar . not particularly strong , but not weak or watered-down in the nose either . t : like the nose -- malty flavors : caramel , burnt sugar and hazelnut but with a slightly bitter aftertaste providing decent balance . m : light-bodied ; plenty of carbonation . could use a little more heft . d : very good -- a light body and solid flavors make this one go down easy . notes : i had this on tap recently after doing some christmas shopping -- a big 23 oz draft -- and it was excellent . may have been a little bit better than the bottle , or it could have been that i really needed a break from shopping at that point .

Review:
	finally got my hands on this one . a beautiful deep scarlet color , with a thick tan head . the head lasted a long time . lots of pine hop aroma , with a some caramel malt and a touch of oaky alcohol . the taste is thick with malt , big citrusy hops , and a little alcohol . i must say the oak aging really does it 's part in mellowing the alcohol and hop bite of the traditional ab . there is a complexity to this beer that is definitely not evident in the original . not a heavy beer at all , it easily belies its 7+ % abv . i could drink a few of these .

Review:
	pours a slightly hazed copper color with a pretty good off-white head on top . keeps a thin lace but leaves a ton of sticky rings on the sides . smells boozy and sweet , with a hot fusel alcohol aroma plus some sweet syrupy caramel , honey , overripe peaches , and booze soaked oranges . really not loving this nose at all . there is some juicy fruit going on here but it 's soaked in booze and it 's overly sweet . taste is a bit better but this is definitely not a top notch dipa i 'm drinking here . it 's quite sweet , with a big candied fruit and honey flavor . there is some fruit , but like the nose , it 's not a bright and floral hoppy sort of fruitiness , but instead a sticky sweet concentrated juice sort of fruit flavor . it 's also pretty boozy and actually feels out of balance in the malt direction , which is surprising for a dipa . i do n't think the 75 ibus were enough for the hefty malt bill on this one , and i also do n't think they were well spent - the hop flavor is very uninspiring , with a moderate level of bitterness for the style . mouthfeel is quite hot but does have a redeeming creaminess to it . still , the alcohol in the back of the throat is too much . frankly , this is one of the worst dipas i 've ever had . it 's a boozy , unbalanced mess , completely lacking in redeeming hop character . i do n't know that i 'd pick up even a reformulated version of this , as this is no easy fix

Review:
	new penny in color . i 'm sorry , forgive me , but i just ca n't get excited about amber ales with no hop aroma . subtle malt aroma , with a light hint of caramel and a suggestion of doughy yeast . you 'd think malt magician larry bell could come up with something a little better smelling than this . mild , mediocre malt flavor , which is very crisp , but overall husky . caramel and toasted malt flavors , with herbaceous , weedy hops . lacking bitterness and a pronounced hop flavor and aroma . this seems like an amber ale from a crappy brewpub .

Review:
	i 've never seen this in texas before so i had to pick it up . santa 's is dark ruby-red in color with a creamy light brown head . aroma is hoppy with some nutty malts mixed in . taste is a nicely balanced ( at least from what i hear about all the different products by rogue ) mix of tasty hops and mildly nutty malts . hops are <unk> emphasized here , but are n't overwhelming . mouthfeel and drinkability are great as predicted . so far this is one of my least favorite beers from rogue and it 's still great . pick this up

Review:
	got this bottle at siciliano 's in <unk> great store if you are in west michigan to visit pours a nice copper color with a big head that settles down to a light foam within a minute or so . the smell is nice hoppiness , and also a bit yeasty the hops definitely take over in this beer , with some yeastiness & light malt coming through too . there isnt alot of body or dimension to it overall as the hops seem to be the dominant <unk> dryness and bread hints at the end of each sip at the back of my throat goes down a bit bitter with a bit of lacing on the side of the glass and little carbonation i dont think that this is my favorite of this style , but i 'm glad that i tried it . i wonder actually how much better for me ( or the environment ) it is since it is organic

Review:
	frankenfest pours a clear amber color with some small bubbles floating slowly up from the bottom of the glass . on top a fluffy white head grows quickly to a 2 finger width . the head slowly dissolves back to the beer leaving behind lots of nets and sheets of lace on the glass . the aroma is a bit faint and has pleasant notes of caramel malt , apple , peach and some grassy hops . each sip of this medium bodied beer is somewhat chewy with a firm carbonated fizz on the tip of the tongue . the flavor is mainly malt . caramel , toast and a hint of chocolate are present . in the middle there 's some fruity notes of peach . it finishes with a hoppy taste of lemon citrus . once gone a caramel malt taste lingers in the palate . this is an easy drinking , tasty beer . it would definitely make a great seasonal .

Review:
	seems a bit overrated to me . pours out very pale with way too much head and froth all over the place when i uncorked the undisturbed bottle . quite sweet with the whole belgium <unk> thing going for it . there are many better brews from belgium that i enjoy more so i plan to stay away from this pricey monster of a beer . but my advise to bas is to try it as most <unk> seem to like it .

Review:
	22 oz . bomber , as seen in the picture . golden yellow with a slight chill haze and substantial amount of carbonation . a thin white head that dissipates quickly . not much lace to speak of . banana and clove aroma along with a honey sweetness . very smooth up front , despite the carbonation . not much going up front , except a hint at what i get to be turmeric . the esters make their way out in the middle and end . cloves predominate . on the sweet side in the end with a hint of bitterness . reminds me of a less sweet version of dogfish head 's chateau jiahu . alcohol well disguised , but a bit on the sweet side for me .

	poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a wine glass . appearance : honey/golden color with light- to medium-carbonation visible . no head , just a trace of foam around the edges of the glass . smell : what smell ? a little chlorine ? some old citrus taste/mouthfeel : nothing at first , but as the carbonation opens up a little , there are some citrus tones , spicy hop flavor . weird strained grain presence later on . very light on the palate , which is easily the best thing about this beer . drinkability : worth a try , but not a re-try . too bad this was a 22 ounce bottle .

Review:
	cheers to goblinmunkey7 for half of this beer review adapted from notes taken 4/2/11 note : written in my notes as <unk> of the brown ale . ' uhhh ... appearance : brown with some hints of red , a nice , wispy white head with some lacing smell : mostly uninteresting - <unk> biscuits , caramel malts , toasted grains , some earthy hops taste : not bad , not exciting - dry biscuits , caramel malts , some hints of burnt malts , grains - hops seem very english in nature - hints of nuts mouthfeel : smooth , a little light but it works , nicely carbonated overall : pretty boring but definitely not bad as far as brown ales go , this is a little above average . i would drink this again , but i would n't seek it out . i do n't find it legendary .

Review:
	use to drink this from time to time when it was still called <unk> , but just as good still . a : light creamy head that fades quickly , light golden amber pale color with pretty good clarity n : nose has a light belgian quality with some sweetness maybe candi sugar t : taste is light and ambery but has some belgian sweet candi sugar and a slight bitter aftertaste , it has a slight tangy quality m : a light to medium body that <unk> over the tongue with decent carbonation . f : it finishes a little sweet and bitter and lingers , makes you smack your mouth a little , not bad , but could be better i think , the two main flavors , belgian malts and hops , seem to clash , not enough belgian and too much hops imho .

Review:
	this beer pours a whiskey brown with a touch of gold . the head starts tall , even and egg shell white , but fell to a thin film leaving some spots of lace . smells of succulent juicy hops with nectarines and tasty pine . underneath lies a powdery confectioners sugar . the smell 's simple , but it has me drooling . tastes of a biscuit dough and rye crisp malt with a tiny hint of honey that is hidden behind a tingly swarm of bubbles that distribute little pecks of grapefruit and piney hops . finishes with a bit of dark wheat that goes well with the lingering dryness . the mouth feel is really light and creamy smooth with a swarm of bubbles that nip at my mouth dispersing the dryness . this one 's really easy to drink and a nice change of pace for hoppy beers .

Review:
	this beer is very good , but the consistency is not that great . about half the time i get , it is very thin and has very little flavor . the other half , it is great . it is almost pitch black colored and has a nice white head . it is very thick nad has a rather nice burnt malt taste with a little bit of a chocolate taste . it is one of the brewpubs weakest beers in terms of alcohol content . overall is a good brew , but they need to work on its consistency . it is offered at different times throughout the year .

Review:
	bottle generously shared by thirstybird earlier in january . pour is bright straw yellow with a thin , fluffy head . nose is puckeringly sour , lots of citric and lactic notes , good earthiness , a touch of cereal/grain . taste is a fruit explosion -- pineapple dominates , peach/apricot and citrus follow , much less funk in the taste than the smell would indicate . mouthfeel is classic gueuze , good body and spot-on carbonation . will probably age very well . incredibly impressive for any american brewery to construct a gueuze like this . never bet against lost abbey sours .

Review:
	poured from a bottle ( 1006 = 2011 , 6th day ) from the beer fridge at 45 degrees into a spiegelau stemmed pilsner ( tulip ) glass . poured 3/4 straight , then swirled the remainder to stir up the bottling yeast for the final 1/4 pour . a : orangy-gold colored , somewhat cloudy due to the bottling yeast , with nice 1-1/2 finger frothy white head . gorgeous matrix of lacing on the glass that sticks around quite a while . maybe the best lacing i 've seen from any beer . s : citrusy and floral hops hit the nose first ( rose petals ) , with a yeasty biscuit aroma hiding behind . orange peel , mild grapefruit t : follows the aroma , citrusy/grapefruity hops prevail with a fair amount of non-sweet malt to back it up . hints of orange peel once again with a cleansing bitterness to finish it off . m : adequate carbonation to carry the flavors , cleans the palate up nicely and finishes very dry . o : a true classic . no aftertaste to speak of , the palate is left completely cleansed after each sip and ready for another . the hops dominate with just enough yeasty goodness to balance it out . everyone should try this at least once in their <unk> career .

Review:
	its hazy mahogany body is topped by a light tan head of foam that holds quite well and leaves some jagged and craggy rings of lace at the outset . the nose is yeasty and fruity above a mildly caramelish and nutty malt . the body is medium/light and its very fine , natural carbonation is lightly zesty in the mouth . chocolate and caramel mingle well together in the flavor along with a slight fruitiness , a light yeast bite , and some leafy hops . it 's well balanced by a low-key bitterness and it finishes short and dry with just some residual nutty malt . this is probably quite excellent in cask conditioned form , but it seems to fall a bit short in the bottle .

Review:
	pours out very dark to the point of pitch , a white head bubbles like uncooked pizza dough ... smells of light coca cola and wheat sweet wet grains and roast sweet and sour immediately come to tongue with a split wheat flavor . almost a sourdough afterthought . not too complicated , but then it is not meant to be . without that semi sour tinge this would perhaps be a waste of time mouthfeel is light bodied with champagne bubbles you could drink these until you die because the flavor wo n't slow you down . it is a weak beer and maybe something to give to beginners to cut their palates on

Review:
	500ml slim brown bottle , bb 10/08 , served lightly chilled in a pint-size weizen glass . a : looking like a <unk> bier , with an elegant bright reddish amber hue , coming with a well-lasting layer of creamy off-white froth on top of abundant streams of fine carbonation . s : a good level of prune-ish sourness ( likely due to prolonged <unk> of the unfiltered product ) , and caramelised sugary malt dominates the aroma , backed by apple-ly fruits , doughy notes , and a touch of dust like most <unk> . t : a soothing flavour of lightly infused black-tea-ish bitterness precedes a <unk> swallow of apple-ly fruits and floral hops ... turning slightly more bitter in the aftertaste , with plenty of mildly-flavoured herbal hops to linger as well as the prune-ish sour-sweet fruits . m & d : the carbonation comes so soothing and not imposing at all , plus the slightly sour and length bitter palate , this landbier proves a very easy-to-drink example of the style .

Review:
	this triple pours a yellow/amber color with large carbonation and a thick creamy head . the head diminishes quickly but leave a smooth layer of sticky lace . the smell is earthy , but somewhat fruity ( cotton candyish ) with a hint of cherries . the flavor has stong hints of alcohol , with a sweet start and a very quick dry finish- like a wine . smoother and sweeter as it warms . the mouth feel is creamy and smooth with a somewhat dry finish . imho : the temperature has a significant impact in the representation of the flavor and consistency . i really felt i had it at the best temp possible when i first tasted it , and was somewhat disappointed . as the beer warmed it became much smoother , sweeter and well balanced . a pretty good belgian

Review:
	a decent flavored pale ale , but nothing to write home about . pours a medium gold/copper in color , slightly hazy with notable carbonation . has a thick fizzy white head that receded into a thin cap halfway through the pint . nose is quite hoppy , lots of floral aromatics . taste is also hoppy with a thick oily malt body . the juniper isnt very noticable , slightly spicy in the aftertaste but i 'm thinking the hops really overtook the flavor overall .

Review:
	this beer states it 's bottled after 6 months in the cask . i bought a 500ml bottle for $ 3.99 smells of some mild citrus and papaya notes along with some earthy , grassy notes . the taste is mild all around in flavor along with bitterness . there is some citrus and papaya sweetness in the middle and back . the hop prescence is more grassy and earthy the mouthfeel is really nice , being both creamy and crisp . the aftertaste leaves some grassy and wheat bread notes behind .

Review:
	samuel smith 's old brewery pale ale . 12 oz pours a deep and lively copper -- similar to but darker than the samuel smith 's ipa . wild off white head and sea spray lace . a rich maltiness coupled with some fresh and inviting fruits -- almost candy-like . there 's a wonderfully tempered malt sweetness backed by juicy fruity hops . the malts are biscuity and the hops definitely have a nice bitter punch to them . medium-bodied and dry -- <unk> as an english pale ale should be . it 's also a bit grainy , which adds some interesting texture . this just has such a nice combination of complex but mild flavors that it 's hard to stop quaffing .

Review:
	this beer is hard to find on ba , because as others have noted , the us import bottles list a diferent brewery all together . thank god for the picture of the bottle ! anyway , the beer is a darn nice looking very gold ( like a shiny coin ) . since i poured it , i had a lovely inch of creamy white foam , but alas where did it go ? aroma is probably its <unk> feature : rich , bready , perfumey . tastewise , it is not bad , maltyness <unk> with some perfumey hops . the sweetness in the finish was a bit noticeable ... perhaps a touch more sharp carbonation would have evened that out .

Review:
	12 ounce bottle acquired in a trade with pimpp , thanks for letting me try this beer , split with my roommate tonight poured into my <unk> head snifter with a nice deep brown color , a 3/4 inch vanilla colored head that stuck around a minute or so , some rention but not much lacing smell had maple syrup , butter , cream , tons of different sweet malts , toffe , caramel , a hint of dark fruit , a tiny amount of hoppiness , mostly candy-like scents that lured you in taste was smooth and easy to drink for a scotch ale , tried to pace myself but drank it pretty fast anyways , everything in the aroma is present in its flavor , sweet malt all the way through with a little boozy character thrown in there , vanilla and sugar really stick out , some nice toffee and caramel accents , mild hoppy presence provides some balance , a lot sweeter than i expected overall but was certainly not a bad thing body was fairly thick for this beer style with a limited amount of carbonation , creamy mouthfeel that had a long lasting taste that kept me wanting more could not drink too much of this solely because of its heaviness and high alcohol percentage , very smooth for how sweet it is , alcohol is hidden pretty well and there is no single overwhelming flavor , a couple bottles would do the trick with this one another good beer from founders to add to their list of many , wanted to try this one before i popped open its barrel aged version , backwoods , in a few weeks or so , highly recommended and a damn good beer for its price , think it is available year round to boot , would definitely drink again in the future if i got the opportunity

Review:
	pours a dark brown color with a thin tan head that dissipates quickly . good belgian lacing . aroma of sour vinegar and oak . taste is fruity and sour . lots of oakiness in the flavor but the sourness detracts from the beer not in a good way . finishes quite dry . carbonation is good , not a lot of alcohol warmeth as it is in the 7 % range . might be a lot better with some aging behind it .

Review:
	served from bottle into a delirium tremens snifter . poured burnt orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly . maintained nice lacing throughout the glass . the aroma was comprised of sweet malt , citrus , citrus hop , caramel , and sweet alcohol . the flavor was of sweet malt , citrus , caramel , citrus hop , and subtle sweet alcohol . it had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation . overall this was a pretty good brew . very nice flavor and aroma going on in this one . the caramel sweetness in this one is a nice touch and helped to cut out a lot of the booziness that was present . very nicely balanced aroma as well . an absolute must try for any fan of the style .

Review:
	bottle into a tulip glass a - aggressive pour leads to a big foamy , bubbly head that dissipated pretty quickly and left some lacing on the glass . its a nice bright yellow color and hazy - i could not see through it at all . s - very little smell . some lemons , some malt . nothing overpowering in the least . virtually no hops . t - again , lemons . the description on the website claims there are some tropical fruits , but if those are n't the lemons then i do n't know what they are . there is a honey-ness to it , which is kind of pleasant . d - drinkable , which i guess is the point because the bottle labels it as a 'session ale . ' it 's good , but not great . different from what i usually drink , so i do n't really know what to compare it to . i could drink a few of these though , no problems or complaints .

Review:
	2007 vintage - i have come to the conclusion that many american barleywines , especially bigfoot , do not benefit from long aging . this is a style that emphasize both hops and malt , and if you age it too long , the hops will fade too much . pours a deep burnished copper color with a big thick head leaving much lace on the glass . citrus , pine , lemony , almost spicy hops , with a sweetish caramel-toffee aroma backing it up . hops dominate , but malt is well represented . alcohol evident . intense resiny hops up front along with a big blast of intense maltiness - kettle caramelization , perhaps ... very piney hoppiness . ethanol flavor comes in and makes its presence known as it all melds together for a intensely bittersweet hop-flavored finish . leaves an aftertaste of powerful american c-hops . mouthfeel : medium-full with medium carbonation . creamy with a slick feel on the tongue . drinkability - i like barleywine . this one is a drinkin ' barleywine - well balanced . i have really come to love this beer , and i now always look forward to picking up a case or two when it comes out every year . if sierra nevada asked me to pick a single beer for them to brew year round , this would be it - the best of both worlds , intensely malty and hoppy at the same time .

Review:
	a very nice ale from cooperstown . this good looking brew is a very murky deep red amber with an exquisite and creamy , tightly-formed tan head that retains beautifully and laces with remarkable gusto . beer rarely looks much better than this one does . the nose is very nice and provides hints of yeast , fruit and spice , along with a very strong alcohol sense that seems higher than its rating . a smooth , creamy feel crosses the lips and provides a bready and yeasty sense very quickly . lighter notes of fruit and spice enter as each sip settles in and hints at a very nice complexity . the body is lighter and thinner than normally noted in this style . this is followed by a less than crisp , but notably clean finish . the drinkability seems quite good and i can imagine a setting with several of these consumed .

Review:
	11 oz stubby . code on back <unk> cloudy apricot glow under creamy white head that billows up and settles into fluffy clumps as it falls . no lace enticing sweet spicy orange scent that takes on a slightly metallic , marmalade tone as the level falls the beer warms more marmalade in the flavor with lots of orange and strong apricot tones . the suggestion of pepper in the chilled beer fades as it warms . tinny elements emerge with warmth . prickly carbonation in medium light body . faint resiny finish that lingers until after you forget it 's there and then it reminds you that it 's been a while since you had a sip . i think i short-changed this beer by pouring too carefully . that left a sticky pad of yeast on the bottom , which turned to be quite tasty . i still got a fair amount of spice , but it would have been much more distinctive if i had swirled up the yeast properly .

Review:
	on tap at brixies in brookfield il it pours a muddy brown with a quickly dissipating head . a small ring of bubbles line the edge of the glass . the nose is very reminiscent of rye bread . it 's the most dominating rye smell i 've ever had in a rye beer . it 's just loaded with spiciness , breadiness and malt . i think this beer is now a benchmark on how much rye smell can be packed into a beer the taste has an upfront caramel sweetness to it that then transforms into this rye spicy rye taste in level which are present in the nose . a level of bitterness is there in just enough force to balance the beer from becoming a malt bomb . i 'm unsure of the percentage of malt used in this beer but it has to be fairly high since this beer is just dominated by this heavy rye flavor . i 'm really liking how aggressive it is and his beer screams rye . the carbonation is at a medium level and the mouthfeel is pretty full bodied which helps the beer feel like a liquid loaf of rye bread . it hides the abv perfectly without even a trace of alcohol smell of taste hitting my nose or mouth . it 's really a great beer that defines the style for me currently .

Review:
	poured from the caged adn corked bottle an almost dull yellow , cloudy but with a large foamy head sweet citrus and malt , floral and herbal notes in the nose . yeast and bread also . very pleasant . the taste was dominated by the sweet and citrus , with a good balance of bready/yeasty taste . not very subtle , the taste of this saision can definitely be described as 'big ' . medium to light bodied , the sweet seemed to outweigh any other feel and faded too quickly drinkable for sure but not a fantastic farmhouse ; a good sharing beer and a great effort on victory 's part .

	12-oz bottle poured into a pilsner . a = slightly hazy golden liquid , very small white head with no retention , no lacing . s = light spices , rough grain mustard smells with just a touch of tart vinegar , light notes of plastic though detract from an otherwise good smell . t = light banana , white pepper , lemon zest , coriander . quite a bit going on and all very well balanced . long dry finish . m = medium-light body , good mouthcoating , nice carbonation level . d = good drinkability , i found the sight and smell substandard but the taste made up for it and i could see drinking this one as a session ber on a hot day .

Review:
	got this one on tap at kelly 's olympian in portland . lighting made the colour difficult to ascertain , but i would be surprised if it were n't a very dark brown . came with a good head which stuck around , adding to the feel of the pint . i 'm useless on the sniff test in these smoky bars , so all i could distinguish was a malty cherry whiff . felt very smooth and went down very easily . was sweeter and more syrupy than i would expect an english brown ale to be . the smell did prove indicative of the initial taste , although where i expected it to give way to a somewhat hoppy finish , a thankfully subtle coffee flavour kicked in instead . i detest coffee , but this was subtle enough to be tolerable .

Review:
	not really what i was hoping for after a lovely brooklyn local 2 from the brewery , but its not bad at all . nutty and oily , as promised , but also possesses a wonderful toastiness that really makes the brew . the problem with this beer is it has no backbone , no malty structure to expand upon . its a half-assed pale ale brewed with toasted pecans , which do instill a very nice flavor , but it is frankly not worth opening more than one . other than that , the beer pours a clearish cloudy orange with a thick , retentive head and some sweet , light brown sugar , light hops , and an oily sesame taste . balance is a bit off , with the backbone and nut flavors battling it out for supremacy . decent drinkability , but nothing special .

Review:
	very nice frothy head ; great lace ; the color is light amber with a slight red tinge . the aroma reminds me of tart cherries ( not cranberries ) . the smell is surprising light , mostly a dry malt . i had expected a more robust aroma . tart flavors up front . the flavor of wheat is powerful . again , i taste sour cherries . not a true lambic , but pleasant enough -- probably not one i 'd re-purchase . long sour aftertaste .

Review:
	<unk> purchased at bottle barn in santa rosa , ca . presentation- not sure what size bottle this was ... .maybe an even 20oz ? does have a best by date on the back label . poured into a standard pint glass . appearance- dirty yellow-orange colored pour . the slightest of head ( less than 1/4 inch for sure ) . leaves some ultra light watery lace behind . smell- a touch or cardboard , some sweetend tropical fruit notes and some toasted caramel malts . taste- thankfully the cardboard is gone . pretty heavy on the tropical fruit flavored hops ... a bit overly sweet . a light grainy toasted malt flavor . gets better as you work through the beer . mouthfeel- very lightly carbonated ... not really cask-like , i think just bad bottle <unk> enough to make it decent . drinkability- was hoping for better ... glad i paid only $ 5.99 for this bottle than the regualr almost $ 10 that i see it for everywhere else . hopefully their dipa is better .

Review:
	there is a joke that goes around western michigan that says dont drink too much oberon u will regret it the next day ... not necessarily because of the hangover but because of your stupid actions the night before due to being so hammered . oberon has to be one of the strongest summer beers ive ever tried thus deserving it some due respect ... however bells brewery in general is another story.. apparently the market in the michigan area is weak enough that bells can be so arrogant as to state on the bottom of their six pack that they dont care about peoples criticism of their beers.. well being from the great northwest , land of microbrews , i must say that oberon is the only beer bells produces that even comes close to par with our local brews.. bells reminds me of a small version of redhook ... their product line is mediocre in general . in my humble opinion oberon is the only exception to this statement ... it is definately worth a try if you like heavy strong beers , especially for something different during the summer

Review:
	a- pours out a nice brown color- like the color of black cherry wood . not much head , and not much lacing . s- warm bready notes , like freshly baked puffy whole wheat bread . a touch of fruitiness , and a touch of alcohol . t- quite a complex taste which is greatly appealing to my tongue . there 's a strong malt presence . and then some fruit swoops in from the <unk> cherry , like kirsch . very well blended . and then the aftertaste lingers on as the malt subsides , and the cherries take over , using the power of alcohols . m- too sharp for my taste , and though the bitterness in the aftertaste is okay , i would prefer more while i 'm tasting . d- delicious tasting and i would happily have another .

Review:
	do n't eat yellow snow . snowstorm pours a very crystal copper color with slight brown and red hues . a good foam that remains throughout but limited lacing overall . the smell is toasted with a touch of bready and toffee undertones . some bubblegum sweet hops mixes nicely with a warmer spice such as cinnamon and cloves . the taste has lighter malt tasting then the nose would kick up . a more roasted and astringent taste but a light taste that is n't quiet watery , but close . some caramel and toffee finishes the malt taste but fails to mask the heavier roasted flavors . the hops are not very noticeable . i would have also like to see more of the yeast flavor come out more . this is n't as smooth as an altbeer should be . the yeast is not really noticeable and the malt leaves too much aftertaste kick . very easy to drink but missed the mark for style . it has the advantage of not being yellow so drink away .

Review:
	i 'm not sure where this appeared from in january , but i 'm not complaining . i had a pint ( <unk> ) with my soup and pizza at liberty st . the hops have died down a bit since october , but this is still about the hoppiest pumpkin ale you can find . it starts with big , pulpy pumpkin meat in the aroma and flavor which is followed by a bitter burst of citrus . this is n't the most complexx pumpkin beer , the malts never really came out . but i 'd say it 's the most balanced and certainly one of the more pleasant to drink .

Review:
	hmm , this one does n't seem like the same brew i had a few years ago . looks like a completely different label too . this one has , what looks to be zeus on there , as i remembered the old one just had stone pillars . in any case , it looked ok . it was a little bit of a pale orange ipa with some decent carbonation coming through and a small white head that fades quickly . virtually little to no lacing occuring from this one has a light hoppy , flowery , and malty aroma that seems to be somewhat appealing the taste is alright , although it comes up a bit lighter than what i remembered this one being before . maybe it 's just me but it seems a bit watered down from before it was ok , dog .

Review:

Review:
	pretty descent beer , pretty smooth with a light white head to it . the taste is probably slightly average , but then in finishes sweet and leaves you feeling satisfied . i can see girls being attracted to this kind of beer . it starts out slightly too bitter but then gets better . its a good beer when its around cheap beers because they make this beer taste great compared to them .

Review:
	a : pours a brillant golden straw body with a good size bubbly white head , long lasting , spotty lacing . s : pretty simple nose of sweet grainy malts , some saaz hops maybe , but a standard blonde ale smell t : sweet pale malts upfront with some light citrus hop bitterness , kind of spicy in the finish . tastes like a standard lager . m : light body ; medium carbonation ; smooth and crisp mouthfeel . o : this is another one of the good ones at adirondack . low abv makes it sessionable , and the standard and simple flavor pairs well with almost anything there . i would definitely get it again , but even though it 's a good ale , it 's nothing life-changing .

Review:
	the first thing you notice in your mouth is that this beer is thick . much thicker than most , almost like cough syurp . the taste is of carmel and of lots of malt . it had 8.45 % abv so this is no <unk> ' beer . when enjoying it , remember that drinking 1 is nearly like drinking 2 regular beers . the flavor takes a slight bit of getting used to . once you do , however , you will look forward to <unk> each year when it is brewed . this beer is <unk> with a fine maduro ( darker <unk> for you <unk> smokers out there ) cigar , like a macanudo maduro prince philip cafe or an onyx . hell , even a phillie black tastes better with this brew . cigars and beer should be enjoyed more often imho . and do n't say cigars are bad for you , your drinking beer are n't you

Review:
	the pour into my snifter raises a half-finger head ( spread over a very wide surface , mind you ) that quickly dissipates to a lot of light tan surface bubbles and a thin glass ring . the lacing manages to be pretty thick and entrenched . the body is truly opaque . i 'd allow less head retention , if the abv were comparable to most impys . the aroma is filled with an intense burnt caramel and molasses scent , accompanied by a blast of sweetness . the fruity vinousness is reminiscent slightly of shiraz , but also of the flavors found in chocolate over 70 percent . the taste , which i did n't get to until the glass spent some time warming , is vinous , molasses-filled , very roasted , and excellent . sweet in the start , but leaves a coffee aftertaste , very dry . the mouth is quite thick , and the carbonation is low , but still noticeable . an easy drinking and rich impy .

Review:
	thanks kevin for the opportunity to try this brew a- pours with a crazy , foamy , 3 finger+ white head which eventually settles to 1 finger and some lacing left behind . body is a nearly transparent golden yellow hue . s- vinegar , lemon , acidic tartness , vanilla , and oak . nose overall is very balanced between these characters and very good . t- taste is the epitome of a gueze . hints of sour lemon , acidic tartness and nice backbone of oak and vanilla . finish is conistent with initial flavor but slightly more tart and slightly dry m- very good . smooth with soft carbonation . body is lightweight and slightly yeasty . d- this is an <unk> beer overall and pretty much what i think of when i think of a great classic gueze . i see why this is the example to compare the rest of the style too . i am looking forward to having this again

Review:
	from an 11.2oz bottle with no freshness date , it pour a pale straw color . the three-finger head is large and creamy , forming a stiff foam dome extending beyond the rim of my pils glass . it shows great retention and strands of lace cling in web-like patterns . the smell is of grain and hops , with a bit of lemon peel and strong herbal notes . the flavor profile follows the smell , and the hops are n't overbearing . the mouth is light and clean , and after a burst of bitter hops , actually gets creamy on the end . this is a very drinkable brew , even if it does n't really posess a wealth of personality .

	12oz bottle into my pint glass . looks decent , a brown color ( imagine that ! ) with a tan head . nothing bad , nothing extraordinary . smell is nice , slight roast , some nuttiness , and hint of hops . pretty much to-style . taste is good but a little underwhelming . toffee malt , some slight roast gives chocolate impressions . hoppiness is mild and earthy . just a touch of bitterness . pretty nondescript overall , but nothing offensive . mouthfeel is good , medium body and light carb give a creamy finish . drinkability was nice . i would try this again but wo n't be seeking it out .

Review:
	this one pours a nice almond brown with zip for a head . the aroma is almost entirely malt , but i can also discern some sort of smokiness or herbal smell as well . this is a big lager beer , and i am surprised that i like it . but the flavor is a little too sweet and <unk> for me to drink regularly . i would love for heavyweight to do a regular lager as i am trying this style more and more and finding that it really can have as much taste as an ale if done right . and heavyweight does this right , but its flavors are a bit too strong for regular tasting .

Review:
	pours a very hazy orange with a huge 3 finger head that leaves beautiful lacing . smells of hops and a slight whiff of alcohol and fruits . the taste starts out dominated by the hops followed by the fruits picked up from the nose . one the end there 's a slight sweetness and a hint of alcohol . you can tell this spent some time in the cask and it adds another depth to the already great taste . moderate/light bodied and low carbonation . i could easily drink a few of these despite the higher abv . this beer was a big surprise for me as i picked it up out of the reduced section at my local store . was on sale for 1/2 off so i figured why not and was very happy i did as this is one of the better eipa 's i 've tasted .

Review:
	decided on a whim to have this with lunch today . god what a mistake . suffice to say there was no lacing , and it tasted like lemon grass and pepper . i admire sam adams for what they have done for the craft beer industry , but lament them for their lack of imagination with beers . their only truly good beers are that bullshit marketing 'imperial ' series that come in over priced 4 packs . those are actually good beers . the rest of their line-up is soulless and an embarrassment to craft beer .

Review:
	bottle shared by <unk> , thanks ben . beer is the first bottled example from fullsteam beer is hazy and kind of orange with a nice soft white head moderate carbonation and some lacing on the glass . looks good . aroma is estery and spicy with a little bit of nutmeg or allspice and this spectrum of bubblegum esters , sweetness and breadiness . it 's smells good but there is a lot going on in the ester department . beer is nice , light in body , sweet up front , lots of yeastiness in it with some mild fruit . i do n't think the persimmon comes through very much but i can taste the fruitiness of it . it 's a decent beer , a good winter warmer for sure . i 'd have it again .

	very dark and frothy -- no light escapes here at all . smell of molasses and alcohol . harsh , spicy taste at first ... think bugspray . it mellows though , to a slightly sour , chocolatey brew . mouthfeel is very <unk> , kind of acidic , yet creamy and smooth . interesting , but i do n't know that i would search it out .

Review:
	i thought clear bottle , strike one - but that was the only thing i found wrong here . clean , clear , crisp , refreshing ( do n't i sound like a bud/miller/coors ad ? ) and without the chemical tastes of macros or cheapies ( ah , therein lies the rub ) . what a mass-produced american lager should be . some mellow malts lending it a nice british character , and grassy hops to dry and spice up the finish . even better as it warmed out of the fridge - although it should n't be too warm .

Review:
	pours a clear yellow/gold brew . smell is mild crisp toasted grain and a bit of sweet malt with some fruit in the smell . taste is a little sweet and fairly spicy . nice rich flavor and a bit buttery . mild toasted grain flavor and mild tartness with light hopping makes this a tasty brew . mouthfeel is good . excellent drinkability , a well executed golden ale . this is tasty and easy on the tastebuds . an excellent brew to convert a macro brew drinker with .

Review:
	pours a crystal clear pale yellow with large army of bubbles racing to towards a modest white head . the smell is a musty sweet corn and light malt aroma . almost american macro-ey . the taste is a couple notches above the macro scene though and is fairly interesting . it unleashes a nice wave of black pepper , light fruit , faint malt , and a hint of hops . this is a light bodied brew that finishes slightly dry and it drinks down super easy ! i have to say that i enjoyed this beer and would have it again if the scenario was right

Review:
	cool bottle . grabbed this 22oz at the local beer store . it poored well , and and had a great head . sadly , there was n't ' much detecable aroma . this might not be coincidence , as it had very little bitterness . the lagering produced a clean and full maltiness that 's delightful . the body is very full and the name is quite accurate . this is my first beer from siletz , but not the last .

Review:
	i really like the creemore traditional lager so looked forward to sampling this offering from the same brewery after a friend brought back a tall can from canada . unfortunately , this one was a disappointment . pours with a bright golden hue , clear , with a thin head that dissipates fairly quickly . most of the aroma features malt sweetness , hop character is subdued . that carries over to the flavor , malt sweetness dominates , with the hop flavor and bitterness are lacking for this style . a bready , sweetish flavor features a medium body and lager smoothness . the descriptor on the can says their brewmaster visited <unk> to study and replicate the true czech pilsners . sorry to say he missed the mark . this one needs lots more hop character and depth to make a true czech pils . not recommended .

Review:
	great appearance . this stout was good and extremely drinkable , tasted like 6 % not 12.5 % , that 's an accomplishment . mouthfeel was a bit thin and this stout had a very smoky quality , lots of burnt , charred oak notes . some dark overripe raspberry is in there as is some graham . nice beer and the mouthfeel was smooth , just needed to be thicker . this was more like an imperial porter/imperial stout hybrid .

Review:
	pours a cloudy amber color with large off white head and some lacing . smells of hops and lightly roasted malts . nice balance of malty up front and a piney hoppy clean finish . more hops than i usually taste in a lager , almost pale aleish highly drinkable with smooth somewhat dry finish . not always on the brooklyn bandwagon this was a pleasant suprise . a hoppy ultra smooth lager that will please pale ale fans and lager fans .

Review:
	presentation : 9.3 oz bottle . harvey 's christmas ale 2000 . 8.6 % abv . appearance : cloudy , light , coppery caramel color with thin tan foam . smell : a slight whiff of lactic acid ( perhaps a slightly off bottle ) was the only negative about this beer . otherwise , a sweet , malty and yeasty aroma with a hint of fruit . taste : rich caramel and toffee malt flavors with a touch of oak and spice , with a bit of hop bitterness in the finish . the hops carried over to the aftertaste as well . mouthfeel : rich and smooth . low carbonation . drinkability : very good . other than the slight hint of lactic acid , this was a very tasty brew .

Review:
	do yourself a favor and shine the beam of a very strong flashlight through a glass of fat bastard . the color will surprise and astonish you . fat bastard is very clear and pours the color of walnut . but in bright light the color is blood ; deep , lustrous blood , like something gushing from steven king 's elevator . as a beer , it 's compellingly beautiful a fruit-laden smell escapes the contours of the glass with a dark puree of plum , apricot , fig , melon , and a hint of cola nut . no peat is found here though this will make a late appearance in the taste the flavor likewise reflects this fruited complexity and is comparable to a sedate barleywine . a slight syrupy taste and aroma are present though nothing sugary lingers at the lip . as the name might suggest , fat bastard is a heavy beer with a dense body , low co2 , and no head or lace to speak of . great to drink now , but some cellaring or cask conditioning might yield even greater polish .

Review:
	a : a hazy reddish brown with a tall thick orange/brown head . the head sat about a half inch above the rim of the glass for a good 3 minutes . s : a very nice herbal , pine and earthy hop aroma . t : the hop starts right up front with some pine flavors and then the bitterness kicks in and fades to reveal an oak-like toasted and carmel malt flavor . alcohol flavor and feel throughout . m : medium-heavy body . carbonation is right on . a little oily , but the bitterness leaves the mouth somewhat dry . o : a nice imperial red ale . maybe a little hop heavy at first , but i like how there is a nice toasted/caramel malt flavor in the end .

Review:
	a slight disappointment . i figured the oaking factor would start with ab as a baseline and add a great deal of taste and depth . not necessarily so . yes , slightly more vanilla scents and a bit more of a chocolate and roasted malt undertone than ab , but not hugely noticeable . bottom line : if you 're a fan of ab , you 'll like this one as well . not much more , and prob not enough to justify the added cost of this over regular ol ' dependable ab .

Review:
	a : a very light golden color with an extremely thin head on a hard pour and no lacing on the glass . it had very light carbonation showing and very filtered look . s : has a strong apricot and strawberry fruit smells with a mild and pleasant yeast scent . t : the taste is kind of light in citrus and hops . i am picking up a slight yeast and malt undertone in the aftertaste . but it is mostly floral in flavor . m/d : the feel is light almost watery and lacking bitterness from significant amounts of hops . the drinkabilility is good in that it is light and thirst quenching . a decent starting beer for the night .

Review:
	ooooo hello citrus hops ! i picked up a few bottles for a mix pack of new brews last week and , not gon na lie , returned the next day and bought a fully qualified sixer of this gem . i got a face full of grapefruit and piney hops the second i poured this pale golden , ever so slightly hazed beer into my pint . the taste surely did not disappoint either ! the body itself was light and crisp , perfect for a summer day , and the hops are not lacking at all in this one . the carbonation was spot on as well imo . i normally do not go for american wheats , however given all the hoppy goodness lagunitas pumps out i gave it a shot . i recommend this beer the hardest part right now is finding it at other beer stores in my area . when i ask for lagunitas <unk> sumpin ' i get the 'ok yeah if you do n't know the name how can i find it ' response , no matter how hard i try to preface my request with a warning .

Review:
	a - golden body with some oranginess to it . nice full off-white head at first that settles down to a consistent foam covering . good lacing . s - vague vinegar , an apparition of apple , hint of mint and just a little gin . t - sour , yes , but not overwhelmingly so . it 's a concentrated sourness that feels like it 's sticking mainly to the middle of the mouth before sliding down the throat . the vinegar flavor and slight sweetness brings to mind a combination of a white wine mix with an apple cider . later the sweet & sour mix covers the entire tongue . m - it hits just about every part of the mouth in the end . tart , but not <unk> tart . fuzzy carbonation tingles the nose a bit . d - the style makes for an acquired taste . it 's not really for me , but i can sip this one as well as any of the other top-notch tongue twisting styles .

Review:
	big thanks goes out to the individual ( ca n't remember who it was as i do n't have my spreadsheet in front of me ) who sent me this one in a past trade ! 2009 vintage ! served from bottle into a mikkeller taster flute . poured reddish brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly . the aroma was comprised of sweet malt , wood , very sweet alcohol , toffee , subtle brown sugar , and a touch of caramel . the flavor was of sweet malt , sweet alcohol , wood , toffee , caramel , and subtle brown sugar . it had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation . overall this was a fairly solid brew . the barrels really shined through on this one and made their presence known . i was n't expecting this as the brew had been aging in my cellar for this long , but was pleasantly surprised what i did find . a solid offering from great divide and i look forward to trying the bottle of ba old ruffian i have in my cellar to <unk> the set .

	poured a rather bright orange colour ( like a muted fanta orange ) with a fizzy bubbly head that disappeared pretty quickly . smells very citrussy and sweet with wheaty notes . has a very subtle and moreish grapefruit <unk> beer flavour . very pleasant and refreshing . light on the palate and not too heavy on the fizz . is going down very fast . i could drink this all night could be construed as a girly alcopop type drink ( just without the alcopop tax )

	the beer arrived a clear amber golden with an off-white head which lasted to lace the glass . the aroma was malty with a citrus base , mainly grapefruit . the aroma was mainly hops . the flavor was sweet , like honey , which diminished over time into a citrus ( grapefruit ) flavor and bitterness . the finish was dry with lingering grapefruit into the aftertaste and the body was medium , but seemed just a smidge lighter . pint at mellow mushroom in charlottesville , va .

Review:
	12 oz . bottle poured into a nonic . pours a hazy golden straw color with a nice one finger fluffy white head that quickly dies down to a thin lacing . stickiness is ok at first but pretty weak towards the end . smell is a sugary apricot/peach with a crisp lemongrass blended in . taste , wow , very tart and sour on the tongue at first ... almost like a lemon or orange sour patch kid . very different , not much alcohol taste at all which is just about the only good thing the taste has going . a nice pale malt in the aftertaste takes a while to surface , but it is enjoyable . mouthfeel is very light bodied with a whole buncha carbonation . drinkability lacks a bit just because of how tart it is , but it picks its self up with the lack of alcohol on the nose and tongue . give it a try , but i would n't go out of your way to get one .

	amber color with decent head . a little light , not too much retention . aroma is fairly hoppy , but a little unpleasant . almost like old hops . flavor was most disappointing - decent pale malt backbone but a sour , unpleasant hop flavor dominated . no citrus , spiciness or floral , earthy hops - just sour bitterness . mouthfeel was fine . not too drinkable due to the poor flavor , though . finish was perhaps the best part , as the flavors faded to a decent , clean bitterness . i would not recommend this beer .

Review:
	aroma is a nice mix of hops and dark chocolate aromas with some subtler fruity aromas mixed in . body is flat black and holds a creamy mocha colored head that is thumb thick and diminishes slowly . lace clings to the glass . fore is bittersweet chocolate with very lucious dark cherry notes in the middle . finishes with a roasty bitterness that reminds me of a scaled down version of gonzo imperial porter . i figured this would be decent , but it 's actually very damn good . definitely more aggresively hopped than most porters . that works well here and amplifies the latent coffee notes in the aftertaste . tastes much bigger than you 'd expect from a 6 % abv beer . excellent porter

Review:
	12 oz . bottle poured into a shaker pint . appearance-yellow gold with brilliant clarity and a moderately large white head with decent retention aroma-sweet pils malt , light grassy hops , and a very faint fruit aroma of apples and pears flavor-flavor follows the aroma-light pils malt up front with slight orchard fruit esters . well <unk> in the finish , with low hop bitterness but a rising hay/grass hop flavor . <unk> growing on me as i drink it mouthfeel-medium body , moderate carbonation , and exceptionally smooth though this <unk> my favorite style , <unk> a good example . it is incredibly easy drinking , and i liked it more the more i drank it .

Review:
	this one seems to skirt the fence a bit , not quite a high enough abv % to comfortably sit as a strong ale , however nowhere in the ballpark appearance-wise to remotely be confused for a pale ale . at first the flavour seems more like a brown , but in the end enough complexity to nod back to the 'strong ale ' listing on the label . from a 500ml brown bottle , it pours out a deep translucent ruby brown with bright garnet highlights . tall creamy beige head that settles to a thick tight cap . toasted , nutty , <unk> malt on the nose , subtle wood notes , very light crisp grassy hops . pleasant nutty , toasted caramel flavour , faint sourness in the middle from aging in the whiskey cask , with a smooth warm nutty and woody finish , slight dry caramel , with a lingering aftertaste of peat and smoke . the intensity is rather contained , yet this was still more complex than i had anticipated based on sampling the original <unk> . mouthfeel is on the lighter side , yet with a silky smooth texture that does the whole experience justice , and can easily turn this 'strong ale ' into a session beer . my lasting impression is that of a brown ale with more personality and complexity than they usually come , or that of a lightweight strong ale that nonetheless has some merits and is completely and utterly inoffensive . to step outside the boundaries of style this is a mild yet enjoyable dark ale , and one that i look forward to visiting again from time to time .

Review:

Review:
	bottled in 2004 . pours a brilliant amber-red with a thin white head that quickly fades to lasting ring . sweet malty smell infused with dark raisins , rasberries , port , and a slight floral hops . taste is full and malty , with a strong alcohol presence , some fruity cherry and berry notes , a nice hop bitterness at the end . the alcohol is present in every sip , which i do n't usually like , but it stays smooth and tasty throughout . mouthfeel is full , smooth , and sweet , but does n't become syrupy at all . this is a very good barleywine , i 'm going to age my other bottle for another 6 months and see how it improves .

Review:
	on-tap at lagunitas a : the pour is a hazy straw color with an initially fluffy white head that slowly dies down to a thin layer . s : an amazingly funky and tart aroma is present immediately . lots of sour apples , lemons , and maybe some green grapes along with a subtle wood character and a bit of grass . t : the tartness is bright and green , lots of lemons and apples . the oak , grass , wet straw , and mild earthiness give this beer a great funky balance to the sourness . m : the body is somewhat light and crisp , with a great level of effervescence and slight dryness . d : this is an absolutely fantastic beer . i would drink this like nobody 's business if it was more readily available and/or lagunitas was n't such a drive .

Review:
	poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass . appearance : light golden yellow hue with a touch of haze and a thin finger of fluffy white foam . i hate to say it , but it looks rather like a macro lager , but with a little haze smell : bright , refreshing citrusy/piney hops . this combination is just fantastic ; it really rubs me the right way . i love it . taste : again , the bright and citrusy hops but this time with a little funk added . the wheat adds a bit of light refreshment as well . damn good stuff . mouthfeel : medium body with a good level of well-integrated carbonation . nice and creamy , just the way i like it . drinkability : super refreshing and tasty ; like i said , this beer just rubs me the right way . good stuff .

Review:
	dark brown/ruby red , definitely see-through , with a two finger fluffy tan colored head and very nice lacing . aroma is nice mixture of sweet honey , chocolate and roasty toasty malts . flavor is an odd combination of sweet malts , chocolate being the prominent one , mixed with honey and a little bit of earthy spiciness . i 'm honestly not digging on this flavor profile . body is medium bordering on thin , almost too crisp with a high amount of carbonation . this is not a great beer , probably the most disappointing of sa 's brewmaster collection .

Review:
	poured into a snifter with a generous pour and it produced a creamy off white two inch head that settled but stayed a long time . really good lacing . this is what what a beer is supposed to look like ! smell is hoppy at first then melds to semi sweet malts with some fruit in there as well . very aromatic with the rye coming thru as well . taste is a hoppy maltness all at once then the rye and a little bitterness at the end . got better as it warmed . mouthfeel was creamy and heavy . it coated the entire mouth . overal a very good example of a rye dipa . i wish i would have bought more . worhty of a try .

Review:
	pours a clear golden color with a large white head that quickly settles to a whisp of foam . a lot of carbonation bubbles makes this an exciting looking ale . patches of sticky lacing is left on the glass . the aroma is very subdued . i detect some sweet fruit and maybe a little funk and malt . has an intriging taste . slightly sweet and vinous at the start but a definate tartness in the finish . notes of apple , pears , and cinnamon . alcohol is barely detectable but there is a subtle warming affect . light body with a fizzy carbonation . an effervescent beer if there ever was one . a beer for special occasions . is it more enjoyable than a comparably priced sparkling wine ? i would say it would be an excellant alternative .

Review:
	33cl bottled poured into a grimbergen chalice bottle number <unk> nov 2008 best before jan 2012 a- jet black body with no light penetration . tan 2 finger head that reduces quickly to a crown but this is persistent . lacing is average . s- light dark fruit sweet malt , peatiness of the whisky casks comes through subtlely too . t- delicate sweet malt quality which makes way for the peatiness of the whisky cask . neither flavours outdo each other . it has a single cream note - not sweet , just a savoury thickness , hard to <unk> suggestion of alcohol hot , very smooth . m- low to medium carbonation , perhaps a little chalky in the finish . i think this comes from this single cream consistency quality im getting . d- very nice , nice malt quality of a scottish ale combining with the peatiness of scotlands national drink ( not irn-bru ) . neither qualities overpowering . a lovely sipper .

Review:
	forms mid-sized frothy white head with good retention atop of clear ( gets hazed with the consecutive pourings ) , golden body with uprising streams of bubbles . the head leaves only little short-lived lacing as it fades . the aroma is marriage of peppery spiciness with citrusy , pear and apple-like esters , and candy sugar sweetness . the flavor of medium bodied beer is governed by substantial alcohol warmth acting in sinergy with prominent peppery spiciness ; esters are lesser than in the aroma section and citrusy in character . moderate carbonation and relatively high bitterness induced by generous usage of hallertau hops with spicy and grassy character ( the later indicating dry-hopping ) lend dry finish followed by bitter aftertaste .

Review:
	new glarus coffee stout : in the traditional twelve ounce bottle , with the plain paper label , with a blurb about the beer on the side . not too much head , but what there is a light tan , with some stickiness . the color is pure black , with not even the slightest bit of light penetrating the brew . the aroma is a light , sweet coffee with a hint of molasses . the taste is very nice , with a very dominant malt flavor . despite the name , this beer is not dominated by a coffee/ espresso taste , but rather those flavors simply serve to round out , and give some bite to the roasted malts . very nice , smooth and easy to sip . a great cold weather brew .

Review:
	poured into a 13oz . tulip glass , mahogany to deep amber in color with over a fingers worth of a creamy head . lots of lacing in the glass . an intense floral boquet of hops bursts out immediately in the nose a strong hop presence carries over into the taste , quickly complemented by a sweet caramel , roasted malt backbone , very brilliant and complex taste . there is a crispness and warming in the mouth , medium bodied with a slightly syrupy profile . the alcohol is definitely there , but it is n't blatant for a 9.6 % alc in terms of drinkability , this is definitely a sipper for me , i do n't think i 'd have more than 2 in a sitting . this intense brew is meant to be savored and cherished , rather than quickly consumed . amazingly vibrant beer , one of my personal favorites .

Review:
	pretty auburn with a cream colored small head , strong lacing . aroma is a large lump of leafy late hops , big caramel malt and cherries . taste is a little <unk> with some metallic notes that i get from many mass-produced beers ( saaz ? ) rather dry . boring yeast . fine carbonation level , but what is there seems kinda harsh . finish is n't very good , just graininess , pinesol , and cheezy hops . i am guessing that there was dry-hopping that did n't mesh well . starts off great . change the yeast and get rid of the harsh finish and it would be a really good beer . as it is , it is unpolished . my guess is that they were going after a more marketable snca and just missed the mark by a bit .

Review:
	12oz bottle , best before 9/09 , sampled 5/16/09 . poured into a shaker pint - a deep rust colored beer , very cloudy - creating a bit of a subdued , hazy orange glow . it also has an explosive ecru head that grows to well over 2 fingers , then leaves a foamy fossilized lace pattern after the once proud head has settled . nothing short of impressive , and a bit of an intimidating battle call . smell is a boom of grapefruity hop to the nose , delivered in a malted sugary package , some undertones of earth , and a warming silky alcohol that blends well with the hops to create a sharp punch . a taste that is involved and grows more intense as it warms . i let several sips sit and swish on the tongue for an extended time , and as the seconds go by , the taste grows more intensely hoppy . crisp and grassy up front . supremely sweetened malt lets the beer become full in the mouth . bitter , wild grasses show up again at some point in the middle and are almost overwhelming . biting , but this sensation is enveloped in that huge malt backbone to keep things enjoyable . some dry grains pop towards the end , then are buried by the final punch of oily earthy hop resin . the alcohol has combined again with the hop oils to provide some warm bitter pooling which coats my throat mouthfeel is thick , and heavy on the tongue , a product of the excessive hop oil and the heavy malt presence ; it has just enough sharp carbonation on the tongue to lighten it up , but still remains a bit of a chewy chore . a good beer to sip , a beast .

Review:
	dark brown , opaque body with off white head . nice roasted malt odors with a good vanilla smell in the background . tasty stout . black , patent malt with chocolate and a lot of roasted malt . the edge is taken off by flavors of oak and vanilla mouthfeel is a little thin for a stout , but fairly good . dominion is a solid beer that manages to integrate barrel-aging pretty well .

Review:
	12 ounce bottle poured into atlas mason jar . a : nice 3 finger brown head . over a nice dark body . s : those arrogant hops and arrogant malts . t : <unk> , orange zest , lemon grass , bitterness of an oak sapling branch , caramel apples , and that hop bitterness that would make someone whose never tasted hops cringe , but is oh so good when you develop a taste for it . all this ends in a crisp dry bitterness . m : good d : this is a strong beer but i would say a sixer of a game of cards makes you a man . but only if you motorcycle home with a cigar in your mouth trailing a shower of sparks . a good cigar masks even this beers odeur .

Review:

Review:
	my first in the 'epic ' series . pours somewhat hazy orange . head was not too impressive nor was the retention , no lacing . smell is dead-on for what a belgian should smell like . apple , pear , bread , yeast , and a touch of citrus ( stones signature i think ) . smell is great . taste is very good as well thoough i should note i 'm partial to belgians . sweetness hits you up front then you notice fruity characteristics on the sides of your tounge followed by a warm , slightly bitter sensation on the back of your tounge . carbonation is moderate and mouthfeel is medium , not too thick or thin . overall a great beer , alcohol content is well masked and a great belgian from the boys in escondido .

Review:
	poured into a perfect pint glass . a : nice , 2.5 finger off white head on a golden-orange , very clear body with good active carbonation . this is a very attractive beer . s : smells of fresh , floral and citrusy hops . not overwhelming with just a touch of malt under it . very nice , but not mind blowing . t : hmm , not enough maltyness here for me , the hops come across a good bit sharper , thinning out the beer , making it much less nice . it 's still ok , the hops still taste fresh and good , but still too strong and sharp . m : ok , not great , but enough body to keep me happy .

Review:
	laurelwood has long made the best red ales anywhere . perhaps it 's for this reason that fire road seemed somewhat disappointing compared to free range or bridgid 's irish - this one has a lot to live up to . fire road is certainly a worthy ale , but it 's far more gruff than laurelwood 's other reds . instead of the plush fruitiness that i enjoy in a red ale , fire road has an excess of bittering and lacks malt body . the 68 ibu puts more fire in fire road than i 'd care for still , i should n't complain . this is a spicy beer as if brewed with noble hops and tastes a bit like an overhopped esb . it delivers a spicy-floral aroma and abstract lace above a body of clear dark bronze . but it 's also a bit tannic and takes a little attitude adjustment to appreciate .

Review:
	poured from 16oz bottle . a- pours a deep , dark brown , with red tinges . 1 1/2 finger head that is fairly persistent with little to no lacing s- lovely roasted coffee aroma . sweetness and mild hops are also present . t- bittersweet , roasted malts on the front end . long , lingering dark chocolate and bitter finish . m- smooth , medium light , with medium carbonation d- the porter fan in me really enjoyed this . not quite as much roasted malt or mouthfeel as a porter , but enough to trick my mind a bit . makes me want to explore the style more , especially as blackened voodoo was my craft beer gateway drug almost 20 years ago . may the schwarzbier with you ...

Review:
	picked this up at the foodery in northern liberties batch ten pours a deep gold color almost amber with a thick white head . aroma is a nice coriander and orange peel with some subtle hints of fruity esters . very clean no off aromas . very spicy flavor i get a nice hoppy bittereness that segues into a soft malt background . the spices seem to be coriander , orange peel and some ligt pepper notes , although the pepper could be some of the yeast characteristics and carbonic acid . mouthfeel is good yet it could be dryer for the style . maybe they should try kraeusening a batch to get that dry dupont bite nonetheless for a brewer with no brewery this is an excellent beer , it must be hard to brew on someone else 's system and produce exactly what you are looking for , still i would drink this again as it is a solid belgo-american .

Review:
	i was recommended this beer by a cost plus stock clerk in palm springs , ca . he claimed 'this is the best ipa i 've ever had . ' 'better than stone 's ruination ipa ? , ' i asked he lied . either that or this beer has gone bad . the color was promising . the smell was acceptable , although awfully malty for an ipa . but the taste ... i do n't even know where to begin . it tasted like a chemical spilled into it . was that clerk being a dick ? i 'm ready to pour this out . i hope this is just a terrible mistake and the beer has simply turned , but the store i got it from rotates their stock often enough to make me believe this is just what this beer is

Review:
	12oz bottle poured into a chouffe tulip sits a near pitch black with some cola colored edges . a dark khaki head rose two fingers and fell quickly to form a thin collar . some minor , delicate lace . when i first leaned in , port wine and dark fruit hit me hard . fresh roasted coffee and bakers chocolate hold their own along with black strap molasses this beer grew on me the more it warmed . it opened up considerably . plums and cherries , port wine , fresh roasted coffee grounds , and semi sweet chocolate . well-rounded , not overly broad but very deep and rich . creamy , lush medium mouthfeel that feels a lot lighter than it really is . a moderate amount of booze lingers and mixes with coffee oils for a unique finish . a pleasure to drink . robust and rich but never overbearing . there is a reason why this beer is held in high regard .

Review:
	found this at a local grocery store that has a great selection of beers of all types . purchased as part of a six variety six pack from schell brewery . this poured a brilliant golden amber color with a 1 finger head that dissipates into some nice sticky lacing . i thought the taste was lightly malty but sweet with a caramel flavor that dominates . i found it to be pleasantly creamy and not overpowering , one that could definately be a session beer . i have heard that this beer is fantastic when tried on tap .

Review:
	bottled november 4th , 2004 . aged and consumed today , five months later . served cool from storage in my garage but not cold . hops now take a backseat to the roasted malts . the beer is as black as i 've seen them . brown head began about half an inch and has dissipated quite a bit and it now clings to the side of my glass . smells of licorice , tobacco , chocolate , and smoke . taste is more of the same , but with a more noticeable dark chocolate presence . age has not withered this strong stout . mouthfeel is solid as a beer this size should be . carbonation is adequate but not detracting from its drinkability .

	how is this not a top-ranked beer poured black with edges fading to light brown . had a highly brown head that was pocky , cavernous , and popping and reshaping all over the place . left dots and fingers of stain smelled of captivating dark chocolate , calm and high quality roasty wood tone , some dark and roasted sort of spice , and faint molasses notes . smelled subtle and refined and well-done like a good wine . tasted of roasted barley , black and other dark malts , some thin fruit juice-like flavors , and great charred wood chip tones . nascently spicy , it had a finish of dark coffee but not too bitter and dry . also a fairly thin mouthfeel . don & # 8217 ; t know what to make of it : a porter with stout notes and complexity . flavorful and fairly balanced amongst its many flavors , not sure it gets much better than this . a stupendous match with dark chocolate . buy one .

Review:
	12oz bottle purchased as part of a seasonal 12-pack at shaw 's in windham , nh . pours a crystal-clear yellow-amber body with a good inch of off-white head . smells piney herbal hoppy with some rye to balance . herbal minty citrus hops play equal parts with a fair bit of rye and nuttiness . light to medium bodied with moderate to ample carbonation . fairly drinkable . i thought this beer would be less drinkable and more astringent , but this actually turns out to be a super ipa with just enough rye flavor to make it interesting

Review:
	my first time giving this new 'brewery ' a try . this is actually contract-brewed by none other than , duck rabbit ! good choice wolf beer co ... pours much darker than anticipated , a deep orange with only about a half-inch head on it . disappears to a just a ring around edge . leaves decent lacing/webbing . smells of lemon zest , butterscotch , flowers , and slight piney hops well , being brewed by dr , it brings with it that annoying quality that i find in all the other dr brews , the taste of metal . this does n't overpower the brew , but it 's there . tastes of bread and just a hint of hoppy bitterness . mouthfeel is decent . good aftertaste , like buttered bread . i could drink a few of these for sure . looking forward to this brewery making a go of it in the future

Review:
	das leichte helles ' . pours a crystal clear golden body with a foamy white head that drops shortly but keeps a good collar and leaves exceptional lace throughout the glass . the bouquet expresses a bright combination of sweetly grainy malt and fresh grassy and floral hops . the body is light with a gently crisp carbonation that caresses the tongue . the flavor offers a softly sweet grainy maltiness that 's gently balanced by moderate bitterness and a touch of floral hop flavor . it finishes short and dry . a lighter style lager that 's surprisingly full of character and quite refreshing . it offers all of the characteristics of a fine bohemian pilsner , but on a smaller scale . very nice ! this beer proves that a lighter , less filling beer really can taste great as well

Review:
	poured from a 22 oz . bomber into a sam adams tasting glass . the aroma is biscuits , mustiness , alcohol , and a weak grapefruit scent . the appearance is a slightly hazy , dingy , amber color with a very thin off-white head . the taste is biscuits , butterscotch <unk> , and bitterness . the alcohol is not as prominent as i was expecting . the mouthfeel is full , with a bitter ( but not too dry ) finish . the drinkability is good . the strong bitterness lingers on the tongue . i do n't think i could enjoy more than one per session .

Review:
	a - deep ruddy orange with a one finger head that sticks around for a while . some good lace graces the glass , and the amber-orange brew keeps grabbing my attention since it 's much darker than most oktoberfests . s - heavy pumpkin pie and thick scone malt notes , with an overlaying spicy sweetness that balances the pumpkin pie notes . t - super malty , but never overly sweet or cloying due to the tight alcohol attenuation and a lovely autumn hop note . some tootsie roll flavors are in there with a really nice almost chocolate taste . damn good stuff . really unique , but still identifiable as an o-fest . m - medium bodied with a hint of apparent alcohol , but as always ... .i appreciate a little warmth in my beers ( being a scotch and bourbon lover , after all ) . the carbonation is graceful and understated , giving this one a refined and classy finish that leaves lingering notes of pumpkin pie , cinnamon , and autumn leaf hops ( in the background , playing an award wining supporting role ) on the palate . d - i think everything i 've said above pretty much says it : this is good beer . note : after reading other , less generous reviews , i must say that i am a full time malt-head ( the scotch thing again ) in addition to my role as a part-time hop head ... .so i may be slightly partial to malt-heavy brews like this one .

Review:
	poured this into a regular pint glass and my first impression is that it looks lighter than the usual stout . a dark amber color generally , but it allows more light through it than many stouts i 've had . the head is light brown with nice cavities and settles into a thin , but complete layer atop the beer . lacing on the sides of the glass . roasted caramel with hints of chocolate in the nose a tang of carbination gives way to a nice smooth and slippery mouthfeel . robust enough to warrent the stout name nice roasted character with a malty , sweet start gives way to a hop bitterness that lingers almost too long , eventually followed by quick hint of alcohol and a warm full finish . my only complaint is a lingering bitterness that may just be a problem because of personal preference . not the best or most complex stout i 've had , but certainly drinkable and worth a try .

Review:
	london porter pours out a dark brown , nearly black , color . a thick head accompanied the pour , but quickly disappeared and stuck around as very light lacing . the aroma is full of roasted malts and chocolate with fruity notes peaking through . this beer is highly carbonated and unfortunately that makes it difficult to pick out flavors . a somewhat bitter chocolate hits your tongue right away , but give way to a roasted , smokiness . dark fruits surface when the chocolate flavor fades , and hints of alcohol pop up at the very end .

Review:
	12 oz bottle for $ 1.49 at world market a : pours black in the glass , but when held up its really just a deep brown . lots of creamy tan head that leaves big lacing on the glass s : smells mostly of roasted malts and some hints of dark chocolate t : not enough coffee for it to be called 'mocha . ' the taste is the malts first , then the chocolate comes through , and it finishes bitter . very bitter m : what you 'd expect from a porter . d : i would be able to drink a few of these at a time , which is a good quality for a porter nice try by rogue , but it does n't measure up to bell 's or <unk> edmund .

Review:
	great look to the beer with an orange copper body topped with a light tan creamy cap . lots of sweet malt and citrusy hop character in the aroma . the taste is toasty sweetened caramel malt , a hit of ripe orange preserves , and a subtle bitterness form the hops . not too complex and it does n't need to be . it is fantastic the way it is , great mouthfeel , just fills every tastebuds with sweet , hoppy goodness , heavy for the style and while very crisp , it is n't dry or over carbonated . you know when you drink an ice cold coca cola in the burning hot sun after mowing your yard , that feeling you get like : wow ! that was wonderful ! same feeling you get when you put this back . i continue to be impressed with lagunitas .

Review:
	pretty clear for a bottle-conditioned brew . head settles to skim in 30 seconds . about 10 big chunks of yeast . lemony aroma , a touch of cinnamon . sweet and sour flavors , enhanced by aroma . senses of citric and coriander ( and even a touch of dill ? ) , especially pronounced at the mid and back part of the mouth . all the flavors are nevertheless mellow , making this pleasant but a little thin in mouthfeel . despite its use of coriander , not super memorable .

Review:
	pours a dark golden color . the liquid is completely clear with no haze , but a lot of carbonation that creates only a thin white head with very little lacing . smell is of fresh hops . a subtle citrus waft with floral undertones taste falls short in comparison to smell . taste is stronger on the malt with a biscuit taste . the hops are very subtle and barely tasted . mouthfeel has a nice bite to it . very refreshing . drinkability is nice . a good american pale ale . i have had better and i have had worse . a good beer for a drinking session , but it may get boring after a while .

Review:
	picked up this week at tj 's in cary , i thought it would be good in the hot weather . of course , that was before my wife set the ac at 66 so she can walk around in one of my <unk> . but i digress . pours a classic golden lager coor with plenty of <unk> carbonation ands a mighty head tthat quickly cowers to a thin cap . nose is yeasty with fresh , perky noble hops . good for the style . taste is initially overcarbonated to the extreme but then follows up with some solid hop bitterness that carries well into the aftertaste . slight metallic tinge . some floral notes . mouthfeel is reasonably crisp . this is not a bad german pilsner . nothing exceptional but worth a flyer for a buck .

Review:
	serving type- 11.6 ounce bottle poured into a st . bernardus chalice . a- pours a deep amber color with no visible carbonation activity after the pour . a nice two finger white lace that sticks around pretty much throughout . a nice cling to the glass after the pour as well . s- sweet malty smell . t- the sweet malty flavor comes out again in the taste . the malty flavor hides the strength of this beer , the only hints you get that this has a double digit abv is the subtle alcohol taste you get at the very end of the . that combination could be a problem if someone where to drink too many of these . overall a very easy drinking beer . this is my final beer that i bought in a st . bernardus gift pack . i am not a huge fan of the malt bomb beers but this is not that bad . something that i would have again as a change up from the hoppy ipa 's that i usually favor .

Review:
	pours brown with a thin white head , quickly settles to a film . no lacings . malty aroma . some tart berries , little bit of vanilla , some alcohol . a little bit of tartness up front but the beer settles down to a resounding 'meh ' . aside from some awfully english tasting malt , the aging has left a pleasant enough oakiness to the beer , but it 's very soft carbonation is far too aggressive , makes the beer feel quite thin not the greatest , might be a good intro to the style , offering some decent malt but none of the challenging aspects of a proper example of the style

Review:
	pours a deep dark brown to almost black with a one finger head with a light caramel/brown color . low retention with a quickly disappearing head and little lacing left behind . smells of caramel-like malt and a presence of rye with a subtle hop backing . up front i taste rye and a balance of the malt and hops with a slightly bitter finish followed by an aftertaste mainly of almost a slight chocolately taste and hops . it leaves my mouth feeling watery and a bit sticky as well . overall this is a decent beer and my first sample of any beer by tommyknocker - not bad at all if you 're in to dark <unk> .

	this to me is one of the worst beers of all time . i grabbed this because it was on sale for 3 dollars ( that should have screamed to me that it was terrible ) and i poured it into a regular pint glass . the beer poured a boring piss yellow and the smell was just a tiny bit of something and water . the taste was not there , you get a little malt , but other than that not much at all . the mouthfeel is like highly carbonated water . i couldnt stand it so it went down the drain , as well as the other 5 . dont buy this beer , it is terrible .

Review:
	22oz bottle it pours a red tint with a nice little tuft of tan head . i noted that it was very carbonated aroma of pine and citrus notes balanced with a sweet malt profile made this beer seem very promising . i noted that this beer does deliver the piney goodness of the hops and that it was indeed very rich with dark malts . i found that the hops shine through a little more than the malts and i did pick up some citrus in the taste as well , but i had to strain through the bitterness on the back of the palate . it flows over the mouth and tongue very well with just the right amount of carbonation . the after effects on the tongue downgraded it slightly . this is a very drinkable beer . i 'm picking some more up from bevmo on my next run , assuming they 're not all out .

Review:
	picked up from k & l wine merchants in redwood city , ca . pours a pleasantly thick and pleasantly opaque black-brown colour , just giving hints of copper-brown at the edges . head is large-bubbled , but frothy and firm . lacing is excellent , leaving rivulets of foam down the edge of the glass , much in the lager style . looks great . nose is equal parts smoky , sulphury and roasted . the sulphur character comes no doubt from the heavy fermentation with lager yeast , but it blends rather smoothly and pleasantly with the smoke and dark characters to give a complete picture . it does n't have the deep sweetness i might expect from a baltic porter , but it has depth nonetheless . very nice . taste is similar , with a big dose of smoke from the rauchmalz , which almost overpowers the rest of the characters . but , no , there are more subtle roasted characters , and even the hint of high-cocoa chocolate giving a vague sweetness , and a smoothness to the feel . indeed , the body is a little light and crisp , but this is perfectly to style , and the smoothness of flavour gives it a sheen to work around these things . this is certainly a smoky beer . in fact , the smoke is so dominant it almost makes it truly a smoked beer first , and a baltic porter ( a very distant ) second . i actually genuinely love the smoke character , but i appreciate the style on which it is based as well .

Review:
	a - pours one finger of sticky off-white head . it has a pretty good retention and leaves good lacing . the beer is a slightly hazy copper color . s - lots of hops . a mix of piny and citrusy hops are most prominent in the aroma . m - a light-medium bodied beer with a slick feel from the hops oil . t - the biscuit like malts hit first followed by a nice does of citrus hops . some bitter hops round up the end leaving a nice finish . a slight fruity flavor lingers in the aftertaste as the bitterness dies down . a very delicious ipa it goes down easy and is pretty drinkable for it 's abv . this is my first offering from clipper city brewing , and i must say i 'm impressed . i 'm interested in seeing what else they have to offer .

Review:
	bomber poured into my duvel tulip , not sure of the vintage as the bottle was undated , the name of the beer was stenciled on the label rather than hand written ( maybe that helps ) . appearance : amber in color , little to no head even after a <unk> , what little head there was quickly recedes to a thin ring . smell : sweetness on the nose , maybe some spice ; however , it is the honey like sweetness that is dominant . taste : again , this is a sweet beer and unlike most tripels it remains sweet with very little bitterness on the finish . this has a honey-like flavor mostly . the hops manage to introduce enough balance to keep the beer from becoming cloying . this is an enjoyable beer ( especially if you like a sweeter beer ) but it really would be an odd fit for the tripel style . you do get hints of spice ( and maybe some citrus notes ) as you continue drinking mouthfeel : there is enough carbonation to keep the beer from becoming syrupy and that adds to the overall enjoyment . overall : different for a triple , not bad , but not great . an above average beer for sure . <unk> definitely try it again if they had it on tap when i was in for a visit . abv is well masked .

Review:
	from notes . tasted on draft at <unk> . pours oily black with a thin brown lace head . aromas are vanilla , bourbon , caramel , milk chocolate , molasses , and a hint of smoke . it also leaves a spicy tingle on the nostrils . the beer starts off sweet with bourbon , caramel , molasses , vanilla , and moves to some bitterness . the chiles really kick in on the back of the palate with a delayed and slow , spicy burn . the body is huge with light carbonation and a super long , slightly bitter finish that left me with a spicy burning sensation for almost thirty minutes afterward .

Review:
	i took a gamble on a case of this hsa ( as a 2002-2003 the store had it in the discounted out-of-date section ) . it poured a clear dark orangy gold with a minimal head . the initial aroma was of sharp spices and maple malts . there 's also a touch bitter of hops back there somewhere as well . the mouthfeel is luscious -- a medium thickness offset by modest carbonation . the taste is reasonably well balanced ; there a syrupy cherry and pear sweetness at the start , but it fades quickly as the hops kick in , and the finish is rather tart . the alcohol is more evident in the taste than i expected for a 7 % brew ; i think it 's more potent than reported .

Review:
	appearance : split a bomber at poppy 's pizza in estas park , colorado after a fantastic meal . i 'm not generally a huge fan of moylan 's labels , but i really liked the brown label on the old blarney . it seemed to fit the style and the beer itself very well . more importantly , though , once it left the bottle , the old blarney poured a deep , copper-red with a thick , foamy and off-white head . good looking . smell : dynamite smell with some strong chocolate flavors and a some sweet malty notes as well . taste : quite hoppy for a barleywine with as much malt as i smelled in it , which is a good thing . again , there was plenty of chocolate present along with some sweet notes , but it finished much more dry than most barleywines i 've had . mouthfeel : silky and smooth on the way down , this had a nice , warming mouthcoating feel overall : after debating between two barleywines for dessert i am very happy we went this direction . it was an excellent choice to finish off a fantastic meal .

Review:
	this beer pours a fairly cloudy mahogany orange color with a bubbly little head that retains a bit and laces . the aroma is liqueur like with lots of abv presence , lots of biting hops , some raisiny notes , maybe some clove . the smell is quite pungent and a pretty good indication of what is to come . the beer is strong , and does n't hide its alcohol presence all that much . there is a good balance between some bittering hops and sweet malts . there are florals in this beer , some heavy fruit presence , and maybe some orange . this beer is just too strong for its own good . the consistency is quite full bodied , a bit syrupy in consistency , slightly carbonated , and did i mention strong . there is a slight throaty burn to this beer because of its abv . if this were toned down a few notches , it would be more enticing for my tastes .

Review:
	pours a slightly hazy amber-gold , not particularly bright , but the head is an excellent fine-bubbled frothy head . lacing is truly excellent . truly an excellent looking brew . lots of american hoppiness on the nose , lots of luscious fruit , citrus and a bit of pine or pepper . there 's a vaguely undermining diacetyl character , but not huge , but it is really quite reminiscent of a west coast us ipa . very nice . taste is also pretty true to style . an initial <unk> hybridisation , which wells through a light acidic note before descending to a raw and very robust bitterness . quite a high level of bitterness - i have to say it 's one of the few beers i 've yet had from outside the us that has the balls to bitter hop so heavily . something for the danish hopheads , and those of us outside who are lucky enough to get a hold of it . mouthfeel is a big and sparkling adventure . big , bold and exciting - it does n't quite have the freshness , and the balanced complexity of hop characters as some of my favourite american examples , but this is certainly one to savour and rejoice that we can get here in australia

Review:
	serving 12oz bottle initially shows a dark mahogany color but reveals a transparent deep ruby color when held up to natural light . half a finger worth of frothy hot chocolate colored head quickly dissapates leaving a paper-thin ring of froth encircled a patchy layer of fine suds . a few small pillars of fine bubbles channel carbonation to the beer 's surface . nutty oil , burnt caramel malt , grassy hop and earthy aromas with hints of bitter citrus peel play on a slightly closed nose malty , burnt caramel and nougat mix with flat , austere bitter and grassy flavors on the entry though the mid palate evolving into a slightly tannic , dry and bittery nutty finish with a zing of citrus zest . a mediocre attempt at a balanced brew , this does n't have the malt nor hop backbone and structure to support the odd off-flavors . sadly , it does not have much substance to offer beyond the austere bitterness , grassy flavors and bitter , nutty finish in effect lowering the flavor score . light to medium bodied for a schwarzbier , this leaves only an unpleasant bitter flavor behind with little malt presence and it does n't coat the palate like others in the style . a thin body aids drinkability though just enough to earn it a slightly below average score . i remember this beer being much better in the past , perhaps this was an old bottle ? no freshness date is present on th bottle ; i will have to revisit this one in the near future .

Review:
	<unk> $ 4.99 22 oz . 11.00 % no best by date pours a hazy medium brown highlighted with orange , and topped by an inch of tight white head that settles slowly lacing the glass nicely . bursting with jammy grapefruit aroma , intensely focused and potent with a mildly sweet malt backbone . 153 ibu 's according to the bottle , this is surprisingly well balanced , and not as hoppy as i was expecting . nicely sweet with bitter grapefruit overtones . mouthfeel is smooth and creamy , and somehow the 11 % abv is entirely masked . this goes down easy , which is frightening , considering how potent this beer is .

Review:
	oh mama ... mama i 'm comin ' home ... yo mama did n't raise no ugly beers ... too many euphemisms to apply to this one . i received a super fresh growler of the masala mama courtesy of a trade with tavernjef , and i am certainly glad to have tried it , and given that i 'm most of the way through the growler , i must have liked it ... ok enough banter , on to the beer . mama poured herself into my glass a scintillating orange <unk> piled high with two fat fingers of persistent off white foam ... and we 're not talking lacing here , we 're talking full length curtains . aroma is dripping with fresh hops , i picture myself wading through a fresh mown field on the verge of an evergreen forest ... was that pine sap i just felt dripping on my shoulder ? taste is a stealthy assault of bitterness at first before blossoming into true hop glory , with myriad flavors of grapefruit , pine , and green grass . all that hop flavor is packed in without being overpowering or astringent . after getting over the hop blitzkrieg imparted in the first wave , a good sweet maltiness becomes apparent with just a hint of <unk> malt flavor . finish brings back the bitterness and stays with you as a silent reminder that mama 's always watching . body is medium to a bit thick for an ipa but the mouthfeel is smooth enough to make you cry for mama . flavors and complexity build as the mama warms a bit , bringing out orchard peaches and other fruity esters . this stuff would be great on a hot summer day or , well any other time you can get it ... .damn good stuff .

Review:

Review:
	this the seasonal offering by long valley pub ; it is listed as a strong english ale that is <unk> hopped ' and does not use spices . from the tap it is poured into a pint glass : a nice medium amber with a brownish tinge . it has a lingering thick head and substantial lacing that hangs on the glass . the aroma is strongly hopped and definitely has more notes of american hops than english style strong ale . there is some bread and toast aroma beneath the grapefruit like hops . i personally would have preferred more depth and balance . the flavor follows this and is hoppy upfront ; there is a caramel and sweet toastiness but it does n't seem as well balanced . the flavor overall seems a bit thin for a beer that ranks in between 6.5-7 percent according do the bartender . it is certainly not a bad flavor , but also nothing that i thought was exceptional . the mouthfeel is good and has some body which helps lend more smoothness . in fact i think the mouthfeel is one of the stronger points of this particular beer . i found it to be very drinkable , just not particularly memorable .

Review:
	clean eggshell white that drops a full peg although its imprints remain stitched into the glass . processions of bubbles parade top to bottom . a lusterless cider complexion . it looks about as standard a macro lager as there is the smell is trademark macro lager stink : corn , chemicals , and stale water . my nose can detect some malted grain that is spoiled by the aforementioned . the fact that i can still manage to extract some sense of straw says a little something ; at least it is not completely ridden with corn the taste is ripe with sweet yellow corn with a quenching finish of straw malt . a flavour saturated with damp grains give it some weight on the palate , the <unk> ' far more responsible than the grain bill . it is a little watery , which is better than adjunct-y . the aftertaste and unpleasantness is minimal , although a complete absence of bitterness allows a lot of sweetness to go unwelcomely unchecked i 've seen these green bottles in open six packs as far west as california and as far east as poland . i 've never had an issue with it , but i 'd advise a change because <unk> 's oldest independent brewery ' does in fact offer a lager a little cleaner drinking than its now foreign owned counterparts . drink it cold , and expect what is to be expected .

Review:

Review:
	sampled at the 2003 maine brewers ' fest . retro porter ' produced a nice foamy head but it was bashful -- after a few minutes , where the head lingered and grew turned into a dark <unk> pupil with an iris of what remained of the foamy head . the flavor came on with a rather earthy character- reminding me of the 'black gold ' of the forest floor and conjuring images of the dark wild woods . in fact , i 'd use this flavor note to characterize this porter . after the initial earthy notes pass , a hops bitterness remains ; subtle malt hints continued on my palate to taper down to a long lasting flavor and a clean finish . hints of toasted malt way down on the finish profile <unk> in conclusion , primarily an interesting porter because of the earthy like flavor start . i 'd like a little more flavor body with a heavier mouthfeel , but as it is , it 's perfectly permissible for a porter .

Review:
	from a 2007 ceramic bottle the was 750 ml in size this poured a very deep and slightly hazy copper garnet color with a very thick and long last tan hear that left great lacing . nose of floral and citrus hops , and sweet malts . mouthfeel thick and oily . flavor is sweet and slightly bitter , and you sure notice the <unk> . bitter finish . however the 11.5 % alcohol starts to numb the tongue near the finish . this probably could have used another year on the shelf . served at cellar temperature - 55 degrees .

Review:
	great for the price . no complaints there this is a light clear straw color with a thin head . as for the smell , it is similar to the typical adjunct lager . lightly hoppy , but pretty watered down . there is n't much to it . the taste is grainy and bready . the bready is n't like a belgian , but almost stale tasting . i do n't mean this in a negative way , but just as a means of distinguishing the two . it is n't as watered down as i expected . not too bad for the price this is an easy drinker . i enjoyed it . i would n't classify it with the best of the best , but for what it is it is pretty decent .

Review:
	i 've always heard of the quality of canadian beer , especially when i was a kid , so when i saw that a local store began carrying a variety of widely available brews , i decided to pick this up , knowing full well of the more than recent molson coors merger as of late . poured into a glass from a standard 12 oz . bottle ; the medium hardness pour produced less than 1/4 ' head , which quickly dissipated . when brought up against the light , this beer shines through with gold . when i put my nose deep in the glass , i smelled little scent at all . light ' nose taste does n't even put it . this is the chiefest disappointment of this brew , seeing as other characteristics of it are quite good . the taste is quite good for a light , n . american brew that is in wide distribution . however , amongst hoppy ales , others take the cake when compared to molson 's golden . a better brew which mimics this style would be founder 's dry hopped , an immensly hoppy , especially fantastic american craft . all in all , i could drink a couple of these , however , i probably wo n't pick up another case of these , unless i am looking for something in the price range and no other suitable alternatives exist .

Review:
	pours a nice deep copper/amber color , with a fluffy , irregular head . aroma is resionus , almost piney . lacing on this is great . taste is rip-roaring hops . i kind of like it , as it 's not the common grapefruity laden hops of most american ipas . it 's slightly different , like i said in aroma , piney . there 's also a touch of sweet malt on the foretaste to balance it , but this one is hop driven . mouthfeel is full , nice . nicely carbonated , without being overcarbonated .

Review:
	poured from a bottle with no freshness date . the color is a cloudy yellow-orange . there is a good amount of carbonation , giving it a sparkly , fizzy mouthfeel . because it was poured slowly , there was no head and therefore , no lacing to speak of the aroma is faint , but , i detect some butter and tangy orange along with peaches and other fruits the taste is lemony with a light body . the hops are very light and there is little malt .

Review:
	12 oz . bottle poured into a pint glass . beer is black with a dark mocha head . very appealing smells of roasted malts , coffee , and lots of chocolate . plenty of hops for an ris . taste is more of the same . i find it leaning more towards chocolate than anything else . hops can definitely be detected behind the malt backbone . the mouthfeel is thick and a bit rough around the edges , which i do n't mind . drinkability is pretty good since i much prefer a thicker ris . i find thinner versions are actually more difficult to drink in any quantity . all around a very good beer .

Review:
	a good example of a belgian-style white beer . hazy , thin golden with little head and few visible bubbles , but a definite effervescence in the mouthfeel . aroma is typical of the style , wheaty with coriander notes . flavours are also typical of the witbier style , but this is a sweet and well balanced example . there are fruit tones in the palate that i do n't pick up in the aroma . not personally my favourite type of beer , but i believe this is very true to style and would compare well against anything in belgium .

Review:
	this beer has a golden appearance with a nice white head . looks like every other pale ale out there , but somewhat above average . nothing else really sets it apart as far as looks went . smell was nice - piney and that 's about all i could get but that is n't a bad thing . rather pleasant and above average . taste was very clean and had a piney hopped finish . really ca n't ask for more from an apa except for something distinctive to set it apart from the rest of them . well executed though . mouthfeel was crisp and clear . no aftertaste . drinkability was excellent . if it was n't so hard to acquire , i 'd definitely drink a lot more of this brew . either that or make more trips down to the grand canyon as i had this on tap at the el tovar cocktail room . it 's well worth drinking , especially if you can find it and enjoy a simple but well-done apa .

Review:
	served into a small tulip glass and shared from a 750 ml . a firm pour yields one finger of bubbly off white foam atop a light brown body , clear and crimson in the light . offers some artsy lacing after settling to a light film . tart cherry and some and light plum on the nose after a light hop presence dissipates with the foam . some vinous grape notes initially , though lessening with air and exposing a bit of light wood and spice . black currant adds some depth , along with a subtle hint of vanilla and carob , then more dark cherry . nicely tart yet not really sour . mostly tart cherry in flavor and with a firm bite of carbonation that tingles the palate . a bit of smoke and wood appear briefly then a moderate fruit sense returns . just a bit rich in viscosity through the finish to truly grab my attention . carbonation holds up well over an hour yet drink is kept in check as the tartness numbs the palate somewhat , though paired with food this would surely not be a <unk>

Review:
	excellent looking beer . perfectly golden , cloudy and supporting a puffy cream-colored head with great retention . bready aroma with classic belgian yeast smells . nothing overly complex . rich flavor , nearly no hopping as far as i can tell despite the name . maybe this is the english-style ipa rather than the american style . bready , a little banana . again , not complex but tasty . highly carbonated and it seems like it just keeps evolving co2 . definitely a sipper , and a meaty beer . classic belgian golden ale , well done .

Review:
	transcribed from notes dated f , 30 july 2010 . this was presented to me directly off of the handpump and the soapy head quickly fell away to wisps . color was a deep coppery-amber with ne-quality clarity . nose had a caramel malt sweetness along with a slight spiciness , kind of peppery . mouthfeel was full , just less than creamy , with notes of caramel and black pepper on the tongue . the <unk> sheet ' mentioned belgian dubbel and ipa yeast with chocolate malt as well as flake rye . i got a mild chocolate sweetness on the immediate finish , followed by a lingering rye spiciness . i began to sweat at that point , having been subjected to so much swill in cans . no wonder this beer has a following attributed to it - phenomenal btw , the most current issue of <unk> ' magazine had an article dedicated to the rye beer resurgence . it makes for a good read .

Review:
	pours to a clear straw golden , forming a small white head which recedes quickly but has good staying power , and the retention is minimal . aroma is <unk> generic american style brewpub pils ... little bit of hops , little bit of malt , touch of rice . mouthfeel is spritzy and very light . carbonation is moderate . taste ... i 'd swear this was a budweiser . same degree of carbonation , same rice taste , same bitterness level , same yeast character ... everything is the same . this is identical . clean finish . no perceptable alcohol . i 'd guess this is in the 3.5-4.5 % abv . no metals or other perceptable off-flavors . hard to believe this is an ale like the bottle says not half bad for a really light hot summer day cookout kinda beer , but i would n't pay anymore for this than budweiser . try it and see if you agree .

Review:
	12oz bottle poured into a shaker pint . a - amber color topped with one finger of soft off-white head . s - bready malt , somewhat doughy , floral , spicy hop aroma . t - more bitter than indicated by the smell . nice malt backbone with a rather dry , cracker-like flavor . citrusy hop flavor reminiscent of orange zest . assertive bitterness that gradually fades into a balanced finish . m - medium body , somewhat coarse on the palate . d - a decent pale ale , but not one of the more exciting of the style .

Review:
	a- orange tinge with exceptional carbonation t- very well balanced and hopped with a nice citrus perhaps even tropical appeal to the flavor . the hop flavor is floral at the end and doesnt linger or coat the palate excessivly s- sweet and citus notes that are enticing and complement that flavor profile m- rounded and smooth followed by a slight bite that blends nicely overall an amazing ipa that isnt too strong , maybe a similar style with a little maltiness wwould be nice but i can appreciate this beer all around , i will be buying more tomorrow

Review:
	a very regular head fades into a thin collar on a very dark amber-red color body . the smell shows a very round maltiness , some caramel , some dark fruits , sweetness , wood and notes of scotch . the taste is of a rich maltiness , showing dark chocolate and coffee with sweet notes of nuts , giving the brew a moccha like flavor . a warming but not overwhelming alcohol aspect appears at the time when hops usually get noticeable . the dark chocolate aspect persists and the finish is a bit sweeter than the body . the mouthfeel is excellent , very round and full , smooth , creamy , almost buttery . thick and chewy , with a low to medium carbonation . a very good beer .

Review:
	pours a deep reddish amber with a finger of off white head that slowly fades , leaving some nice lacing . aroma is sweet caramel malts and some piney and grassy hops , but they 're not particularly fragrant like in an ipa or something like that . i also get some hints of dough , but the sweet malt is dominant . taste is loaded with sweet caramel offset nicely by the advertised 'hop bite . ' i also get some tea in the finish , but i think that could just be an effect of the hops . very full in body with moderate carbonation . smooth for an 8 % strong ale , the hops and malt are so nicely melded , i could easily drink a couple more of these .

Review:
	bud light & clamato chelada has a medium , pink head , which instantly fizzes away and an opaque red appearance , with golden splotches left on the side of the glass . the aroma is of tomato juice and a slight whiff of clam broth . taste is of tomato juice , clam broth , lime flavor , and maybe some bud light . the body is medium to thick , and bud light chelada finishes soupy , like a watery clam chowder . overall , for what it is ( an odd concoction ) , <unk> pretty enjoyable . i recommend it for someone who would like to try something different

Review:
	cloudy brownish amber glass with an unmoving mass of a beige head . attractive aroma of dark malts ( chocolate ) and the standard clove and banana weiss trait . plastic aromas are noted as well , likely a result of this bottle 's age . taste is akin to liquid chocolate-covered banana . slight carmel notes and pepper clove spice round this one out . plastic is noted once again smooth , soft and creamy in mouth . literally like pureed bananas . this must be a stunner when fresh . my bottle was impressive , even though clearly <unk> .

Review:
	pours a slight tangerine orange and straw yellow . the head is nice and bubbly but fades very quickly with a little lacing . smells like wheat and european hops , a little yeast in there too . there is some fruit in there too , but you have to take a good whiff to get it the taste is of wheat , a bit of malt , and a little fruit flavour in there too almost feels like drinking champagne , medium mouthful otherwise easy to drink , but not <unk> i 'd be trying every night

Review:
	pours an amberish golden color with a spritzy off white head that dissipates quickly . alcohol very noticable in the nose . some lighter fruit notes and husky grain and yeast , too . initially sweeter , then moving towards a drier , alcohol-laden finish . alcohol burn at the end . pretty wine-like . the french government imposed a triple tax on beers ( belzebuth was the only french beer at ) 15 % and over , so the brewery revamped the recipe and rereleased it . ca n't say i could have these back-to-back , but a quality warmer anyhow .

Review:
	belgian dark ale they say ? i am thinking not . fairly dark in the glass . slight red edges noticed when held to the light hints of toasted malts , slight burnt edges and ever slight roastiness . taste was pretty nice , more on the lines of a brown ale though , no belgian characteristics that i could find . pretty solid i would say .

Review:
	serving type : 500 ml bottle , no freshness date , poured into a <unk> weizen glass appearance : pours a hazy dark yellow , but still lighter than most hefe-weizens . huge initial head that tightened up to a <unk> half-inch of foam . smell : not unpleasant , but not very assertive , either . lacks that banana bread flavor to which i have grown accustomed with hefeweizens and is reminiscent of a lager . taste : tastes more like an american wheat beer than a hefeweizen . malt flavor is not satisfyingly present . this beer has some of the spiciness typical of the style , but nothing to prop it up . is this the beer that austrian frat boys drink at their parties mouthfeel : lively , refreshing carbonation . thin consistency would wash food down well , but at $ 3.29 a bottle , i 'll stick to the high life for this function . drinkability : this is n't a terrible brew , but is n't really sufficient as a hefeweizen . it 's light and goes down easily , but there are considerably better hefe-weizens widely available i 've got to say , stiegl beers have never really done it for me . they tend to be too light-bodied and lack the complexity appropriate to their styles .

Review:
	clear , brassy reddish orange colour with a collar of white foam and a skim of fine bubbles covering the surface of the beer . floral aroma , perfume , tangerines , vaguely spicy , crackers and oranges . nice flavour . bitterness fit well with the floral flavour and the citrus notes added some depth mid-palate . spices appeared towards the end , melding with lingering floral character . sweetness was more sugary than malty . medium to light bodied with average carbonation , decent texture . a very interesting beer that does n't sacrifice drinkability for uniqueness .

Review:
	12.7 oz . numbered bottle vintage 2004 generously shared by todd hannon from his most awesome cellar for ba bottle share at the beer mongers <unk> . light gold/straw colored body , no visible carbonation , minimal head and lacing . dope funk nose , some characterized as vinegar , i got more of a fermented apple/peach juice aroma , no hops to speak of in the nose . taste is quintessential rodenbach , deep wood aromas , big brett presence , a bit of fruitiness , but overall huge funk , though no horseblanket or leather , overall very very smooth , more sour than tart . this is probably attributable to the unblended 'old ' lambic character of this beer . mouthfeel is medium-light , good effervescence , not sticky . i wish there was more of this to drink , in any case many thanks to todd for sharing this gem .

Review:
	this <unk> <unk> pours a nice light golden yellow . a fat head gave away to a thin lace . the aroma is raspberries , nothing else . the aroma is not overpowering like most fruit beers . the taste is a touch of wheat with the raspberries and a bitter finish with hops . the raspberry flavor washed away to nothing after the swallow . it started out nice but ended up watery . i was hoping for a bit more fruit in the taste . the watery finish does n't make me want to drink more so it is low in drinkability . overall not bad , average or a bit above .

Review:
	let me start by saying it 's exciting to see beers from mexico which have color and substance and flavor . in fact this is the first craft beer i 've ever had from mexico . poured a meager 1 ' head which quickly dissipated to lace . dark in color almost like a stout and flavor likewise was similar to a mild stout but with a lighter body . smell and taste both had touch of sour almost like a drop of flemish sour . anyway , a big step up from forgettable weak mexican beers , but nowhere close to the craft beers from the states or from european classics . but keep up the good work cucapa .

Review:
	time for a re-review , as last review was done at a pub whilst on holidays in nz back in jan/feb : dark brown in colour with low head that disappears quick . low bubbles and some hard lacing a nice a complex mixture of dark chocolate , dark fruits , caramel and nicely roasted coffee palate is nicely bittered and full flavoured with fantastic texture . the flavours are heavy on the chocolate side , with some really intense roast flavours coming on through . really nice bitter chocolate aftertaste . good strong porter from a damn good producer . try also the whisky porter , same stuff just aged in barrel . do n't drink this bad boy too cold

Review:
	clear , pale amber hue , bone white head , smallish but staying . aroma : soft , and slightly hoppy , mostly soapy . minor citrus , but any hoppy kick is muted , at best tasting it : nice hop attack on the palate , dry and brittle in the mouthfeel , before slowly fading back . returns with each sip . medium bodied , lingering hoppy finish gets juicier and brighter toward the end . enjoyable texture . nice taste . feels dry-hopped , and i imagined if it were n't , it would n't be quite so enjoyable . not bad , though , not bad at all .

Review:
	bottle thanks to drgonzo3705 , thanks paul ! poured into a regular pint glass this beer produced an amber/orange color with a very small head . it produced minimal lacing . i could n't get much from the aroma other than hops and a ton of malt . i found that it was very easy to drink and before i knew it the glass was empty . if you want something complex and hoppy you should look elsewhere . as is , it is a good beer to just sit down and watch a game with .

Review:
	this beer was poured into a pilsner glass from the 500ml bottle . this beer pours a clear golden yellow with a decent white head that dissipates to a thin film without much lacing . the smell is sweet and malty , crisp and clean . the taste is also malty up front but has enough hops to balance out the flavor there is a good mouthfeel , a little on the thick side for what it is but still quite good . overall a great beer to tailgate or cool down with in the summer .

Review:
	sparkling yellow hue with large marshmallow head . light hops , corn , alcohol , grass in the nose . grass notes , bready , soapy hops in the finish . smooth but slick in mouthfeel . highly drinkable and enjoyable . sierra nevada is still the kings of hops even though this beer is a more average brew for them .

Review:
	no date on the cork . this ale pours a nice shade of brown . a very thick light tan head was on top and never left . there is a yeasty , fruity aroma with a slight bit of roasted malt . the taste is nice , malt , raisins and tones of bread ( yeast ) mixed in . i enjoyed this beer more than the pale ale from corsendunk .a very smooth drinking dubble and easy to drink more than one . try this , you wont be disappointed .

Review:
	best <unk> . matured in oak barrels for 20 months . pours a clear golden color with a fluffy 1 1/2 finger white head . slight sour fruit aroma in the nose along with a touch of oak . sour tart taste that transitions to sweet and then a slight bitter end . subtle aftertaste of alcohol . slight acidity to this one . light/medium mouthfeel . a little pricey at $ <unk> bottle but pretty satisfied with this one .

Review:
	poured into a pint glass 3.5 a : depending on the lighting , this is orange amber or amber brown in color . about one finger of frothy off-white head dies down quickly , but leaves a decent amount of lacing . 3.5 s : pungent floral and citrus hops with emphasis on pineapple and grapefruit . not much going on malt-wise except for a touch of the standard crystal malt presence . still , reasonably pleasant . 3.0 t : moderate , or maybe more , hop bitterness . crystal malts with a very slight nuttiness . touch of citrusy hops . none of the flavors are very strong other than the bitterness and they do n't go together that well . 3.0 m : medium body . carbonation is a bit too high and is very bity , giving a not very smooth journey down . 3.0 d : this is n't a terrible brew , but it 's hard to figure out what is good about it .

Review:
	a : dark black , cream colored head . thin looking s : smelled of roasted malts and chocolate a tiny bit t : nothing to write home about - it 's a dry stout , a little bitter , not that much malt , but it 's okay m : nice mouthfeel - smooth , dry , and well carbonated o : nowhere near their foreign extra stout , but it 's available . i 'm not a huge fan of the style , i 'd much rather have a russian imperial stout , but in the style this is drinkable but weak .

Review:
	from a 12 oz . label says , ' we have combined the finest belgian malt , rare european hops , and an authentic belgian yeast and finally , the brew is dusted with tulip petals . ' gold to orange in color . chill haze present . aroma is of pineapple and orange juice . little evidence of maltiness or cloves in araoma . first sip reveals sweetness with some hops bitterness . i do n't pick up much spiciness that would lend to more complexity . tastes like drinking pineapple juice with some bitterness . not very high in carbonation that i believe is desirable in this style . candi sugar is evident . beer reveals a little more after allowing to warm . still the sweetness seems to mask any spiciness .

Review:
	took from the fridge and poured directly into a clean glass . nice golden amber color with a little cloudiness from the sediment . average sized soft white head . bright fruity smell of cherries and oranges . <unk> body with medium carbonation . the taste was nothing special . very little alcohol taste present , though it did leave a warming feeling going down . taste was a little dry and malty with only a light hop taste on the finish . i really did n't care for this one very much .

Review:
	a - this one is a semi-transparent chestnut brown with a big fluffy three finer head . there is a reddish tint to this brew , as if the smallest amount of rhubarb or strawberry color shines through . a decent amount of lace is left on the glass , and head retention is awesome . s - i can smell malty scotch notes wafting off this like on of speyside 's finest . up close , this is malty as all get out , with chocolate cake , scotch whisky , flaky pie crust , pound cake , almond puree , and a hint of something darkly fruity . raisins , but only just . there is also something there that is like an old guy 's cologne ... .musty , but distantly floral . like old dead flowers . t - mushrooms , earthy vegetation , sweet malty cake batter , and cashews . soy sauce and thai peanut sauce . oddly lacking in hoppage , but interesting and complex nonetheless . m - medium bodied with almost non-existent carbonation and a slick sugary mouthfeel . this is sort of bland in the mouth , but is redeemed a bit with the nice dry finish . d - too sweet and severely under-hopped . this is sort of a poor stab at a barley wine .

Review:
	basically this is an average beer that would seem good at a party . that is because you can drink six of them and not be too drunk . i remember once having five of these and then having a dog fish head 90 minute . you can believe me when i say that it was a blow out . guess which beer one the tasting contest . it is pretty amusing if you think about it . this is fine for a frat party where the sole purpose is to get drunk .

Review:
	should be kept in the can but if poured , you 'll see a nice amber/orange color . the can really masks the smell of sweet , sweet hops but you 'll get a whiff when you drink it . this doens't seem to be a very complicated pale ale but that does n't make it a less impressive brew . oskar blues defintiely does n't get the respect they deserve . this is a great beer . one of my top five pales . pack it in , pack it out

Review:
	first of a few great divide brews i picked up . pours a dark brown color with very little head . no lacing down the sides . this is a malt centered beer and has the taste of some dark fruits , especially raisins but more so on the finish . subtle hop bitterness . a slight alcohol taste is well balanced for the style . overall this is an ok beer but not something ill be rushing back to the stores to pick up .

Review:
	750ml corked and caged bottle poured into a tulip . ( a ) - pours an almost crimson/ruby color with a nice tan frothy head . some lace . ( s ) - great spices and a creamy pumpkin aroma with the slightest hint at some dry oaky vanilla . smells amazing ( t ) - not as awesome as the smell , but still very good . nice spice and pumpkin characters . the oak aging definitely added a nice dryness and an oakier , almost sherry-like finish to it that is quite nice . ( m ) - a nice carbonation level and balance . spicy , but with awesome creamy pumpkin and dry oak . ( d ) - a great pumpkin beer amidst some rather disappointing ones i have tried over the years . smooth , but tastes dynamic and very enjoyable . the oak aging really created some unique nuances in this .

Review:
	a clear , light molasses pour , almost amber <unk> topped by a thinnish lite brown head . died mighty fast . a very sweet brew with maple syrup and molasses dominating the aromas and tastes . pretty darned thin and lightly carbonated ( not full bodied as the label states ) . this is an easy drinker to add to the summer fun , and would appeal to any crossover drinker candidates . to me , it needs a push to reach the status of <unk> <unk> , but never-the-less , i enjoyed this lil brew . thanks to solomon420 for the desert treat .

Review:
	this beer pours a pale golden color , has a two finger head with a fair amount of retention and some good sticky lacing . the aroma is of pale malt with hints of grassy hops and it 's slightly grainy in the background . the taste is what you would expect from a pale ale it 's crisp , dry , and bitter . the piney hops stand out in the finish . the beer is medium bodied and highly carbonated but is very easy to drink . reflection : this is another good beer from the guys at hylands , if your ever in this area it 's definitely worth seeking out .

	on tap at the belair location pours a nice light amber with an off-white head that fades , but not completely . smells of mildly citrusy hops , but not a strong aroma . not bad , just nothing to get me very excited . taste is just ok . some nice citrusy hop flavors up front , with an unexpectedly bitter bite in the aftertaste . hints of malt help make up some ground , but it 's just a little unbalanced solid body for the style . not a bad brew , and i could drink more than 1 if i 'm bellied up to the bar . but , there are much better apas to be had .

Review:
	poured from a 12oz bottle into my nonic glass . it pours a proper deep , very clear amber with a thick , rising , fluffy , pouty off-white head that sits there for ages and only recedes to a thin but complete covering of the beer after a lot of sips . lacing is phenominal , lots of sticky head bubbles clinging to the glass that mark the beer 's progress . an extremely well-presented ale . smell a little bland ; a little sweet oaty malt smell . taste is a little hoppier than a lot of ales , but it 's a stone brew , and they do hops well . the front half of the tongue is tingled with caramel flavors that are quickly overcome with the acidity of the hops on the way down ; the bitterness hangs around a lot longer than i 'd like , which brings the taste numbers down . mouthfeel is pretty good , a lot of sparse , tight bubbles come together to fizz across the palate , leaving sticky , chewy reminders of the hops for a long time . nothing to write home about . drinkability gets a lower score because of the aftertaste ; it kind of becomes a chore just to finish one of these , much less to reach for another .

Review:
	church brew works - quadzilla ( cherry ) a blend of white topped and silver topped bottles . appearance : appears a reddish amber in color , small fizzy head forms and retention is low . smell : a not so good aroma on this one , smells alittle funky and not so much in a good way . as it warms the cherry comes into play and redeems it somewhat taste : belgian yeast , brown sugar and a complimentary cherry presence making this bottle conditioned ale quite a delight . nice depth of flavor , the whole range of cherry and belgian notes . mouthfeel is adequate , good carbonation on a light to medium body overall i thought this was quite good and worthy of revisiting somewhat often . i feel that the overall effect of this beer is greater than the sum of its parts , and was the best belgian style cherry beer ive encountered thus far . as other tasters have noted , this shares the style with troegs mad elf , but i give credit to the church brew works take on the style , as the alcohol was hidden alot more gracefully . good beer .

	on-tap at the brew kettle , strongsville , oh - <unk> a : served in a 5 oz . white wine glass . pours a mostly clear golden with a small bubbly head . little lacing . s : slightly funky with a citrusy aroma . t : much like the smell . it 's got the characteristic lambic funk , but it seems subdued - apologetic almost . i was expecting more , and to be honest , quite disapointed . complimented by a lemon zest flavor . overall , the taste was light , subtle , and a bit watery . m : light in body with very light and smooth carbonation . again , slightly watery . d : not bad , and this may be a great beer to introduce the uninitiated , but it just does n't have the intensity that i 've come to expect from a belgian lambic or gueuze .

Review:
	pours a dark golden/straw color with a prolific amount of persistent bubbly carbonation that results in an off-white 3-finger head that recedes at a slow pace and leaves no lacing behind . swish it around a bit to open up the aromas . smells malty and buttery with some banana and orange fruitiness in the background . tastes malty up front with some very slight fruitiness and a bit of bitterness to round things out . mouth-feel is light to medium-bodied and very drinkable . anchor is very proud of this brew , and it does have the history to make them feel proud of it , but it does not compare to some of their other standards .

	very good . i love a good ipa and this one was no exception . absolutely delicious . i like sierra nevada 's pale ale but to me this is much better . i wish it was available all year round . appearance : copper colored with about a half inch head . aroma : citrusy hops , lots of hops . taste : bitter/hoppy , citrus , a little malt . i highly recommend it and will definetely be buying more before the end of the season .

Review:
	i was n't impressed at all by the bottled version of this , but after a week straight of upper 90s temperatures i thought it might deserve another evaluation . pours up with a thick , clouded , banana peel color and an inch of creamy head that falls to a small dusting of bubbles about halfway through . the cloudiness is about on par with a german hefeweizen after the yeast has been dumped . some lemongrass and ripened apple accent the bready , wheaty base . this one is definitely balanced away from the hop bitterness at 14 bus . clean , with a nice level of carbonation . the high percentage of wheat gives the perception of a hefty body . i do n't necessarily care for mustang 's approach to brewing , but it 's hard to deny that two or three of these go down pretty easy on a hot summer night .

Review:
	contract brewed by shipyard . fizzy sounding pour , decent head retention . filtered clarity of pale bronze . mild butterscotch aroma , malty with a faint carbonic smell . a little watery on the palate ... this does not have the same fullness as it used to . creamy malt sweetness ... with a light hop presence . i like to put this beer and a diet cream soda to see how close they are .

Review:
	appearance : pours a slightly translucent dark brown color with a rather unimpressive head that reveals the brown liquid beneath with rapidity smell : roasted malt and chocolate taste : chocolate , up front , with a developing roasty taste that adds some hop elements by mid-palate ; after the swallow , the chocolate comes back to the front ; the finish is dry and somewhat crisp mouthfeel : light to medium body with moderate carbonation ; rather thin for the style overall : a pleasant enough beer but the mouthfeel and flavor need to be bigger to get better marks from me

Review:
	a - deep dark almost black body . thick medium brown head . s - the nose is huge chocolate . the chocolate aroma is intense , sweet , roasty and spicy . t - chocolate is foremost and it 's thick , rich , semi sweet chocolate . this is an imperial and the chocolate is almost in semi sweet chocolate syrup form . not many other flavors present except some toasty pumpernickel , warming alcohol and a bitter background . m - thick bodied , viscious and syruppy . its not overwhelming but you can really chew on this beer and it 's great . d - not highly drinkable by most standards , i could still take down a bomber bottle no problem . the flavors are <unk> and intense and its high abv but would consider it more of a savoring sipper . notes - if you 're into huge flavors and intense chocolate than you will love this one . southern tier is a great brewery and this one marks another fine creation .

Review:
	drinking date : 12/18/10 expiration date : not listed glassware : large mug appearance : deep brown in color ; thick cream-colored head that retained fairly well , thinned out about halfway through ; a little lacing . smell : like white bread . not a lot to go on in the aroma , but what was there did not remind me of other past beer smells . taste : immediate roasted malt taste , that drifts away as it passes through . not much happening after that . finishes as it began with a lingering roasted flavor . first taste of the beer is pretty good , but , as i drank , there were no surprises and no complexity to keep me interested mouthfeel : has a little more body whch makes it feel a little larger than your average lager . good bit of carbonation . drinkability : you could drink a few of these no problem , but the average taste and slightly heavier feel make it a less than good choice for steady drinking . notes : not a bad beer , but nothing special . i would try this again if i saw it on draft .

Review:
	like having a bowl of honey nut bunches of malt for breakfast , this beer makes me as happy as a <unk> squirrel going all <unk> <unk> from tree to tree . the fat squirrel is actually pretty interesting especially when compared to most brown ales . its aromas and flavor are a perfectly balanced blend of honey , hazelnut , toast , walnut , and a tad smidgen of vanilla . the mouthfeel is light and smooth . not hoppy in the slightest . quite sweet . too damn drinkable for our own good .

Review:
	a-dark transparent honey with a thin white head s-smells like pine , grapefruit , and salty . good strength t-comes in with a good crisp taste of grapefruit . goes in to a decent taste of piney hops . the tastes are n't overly powerful but they 're nice and crisp . it has a nice after-taste of grapefruit m-creamy medium carbonation with a nice creamy finish o-its definitely an amazing ipa . it compares to the elder , though i think the elder happens to be slightly more robust , but only by a touch . its very well balanced , near perfect for an ipa .

Review:
	i like most sa products so when i saw this i did n't hesitate to grab it . this beer poured a very deep ruby color with a nice sized almost white head . this brew had excellent lacing , more like sheats of foam on the glass . the smell was kind of hidden but i could sense a little maltiness and not much else . the taste was pretty crisp with a nice malt like taste . this brew was not as sweet as i thought it would , however a slight sweetness is detectable . the mouthfeel is very smooth and this brew was easy to drink . i think this might make a good session brew , i could probably drink it all night .

Review:
	best by <unk> pours cloudy amber brown with a 2 finger head that faded fast an left no lacing smell has lots of banana with lightly toasted malt spice from the yeast taste - still get some banana with kicks of booze but i pick up more dark fruit and caramel malt - plenty of spice from the yeast - not very sugary sweet which i like - nice and dry mouthfeel is light/medium with tons of carbonation whcih is very fitting for this style drinkability - i had this after a chimay red tonight and this was the hands down winner no contest

Review:
	pours very dark brown , with reddish at the edges , and a substantial tan-colored head that leaves good lacing . smell is mostly citrus hops , and a bit weak . grapefruit is the dominant fruit , but i have to reach a bit to get it . taste is smooth rich malts , rather subdued , leading into a nice citrus hop punch , that finishes out without much lingering bitterness . the hops are the central character , but they 're backed up well by some malty richness and sweetness . looking at it , i was definitely expecting more roasted malt character than i got . medium-bodied , decent carbonation , not bad , but nothing special . this beer was a bit of a surprise for me . did n't know what to expect , but the dark color without a ton of malt flavor , and the strong citrus hop presence , are just right for a black ipa . quite tasty , better balanced than many beers like it , and one i 'm quite likely to drink again .

Review:
	enjoyed at the first annual summer saison tasting a huge thanks to a most generous beer trader - beerbeing . alex , you are the man a very frothy head and intriguing appearance . the top half of the body is glazed right over while the bottom half holds large bouts of clarity . the aroma imparts notes of spice and lemon as well as strong yeast and a slight sourness . it 's light , easy going and quite nice . a small part of the alcohol strength is detected in the mouthfeel ; it 's damp and thick bodied . a good balance between the malt and spices ( of which it 's not too heavy on ) . this is simple and my lasting impression is one that holds this being a very nice saison

Review:
	pours deep black with a thin , off color head . the aroma is fair , woody and slightly roasted . the flavor is thinner than i expected , starting roasted and bitter , finishing bitter and woody , but largely lacking any flavor in between . it is , in fact dry , but i find it rather flat as well ( flavorwise , not in carbonation , which is adequate . the mouthfeel is awfully thin for a stout of any sort . ok , drinkable , but overall it feels more like some pallid offering from a macro brewer than something produced by a craft brewer .

Review:
	let 's pit the simcoe single hop versus the nugget , warrior , and cascade versions . appearance : pours out cloudy , burnt orange body with a full inch of lasting , off-white foam . smell : delicately toasted malts with notes of cookies and grains with a rich scent of <unk> citrus wedges spritzed with pine . taste : lightly toasted base maltiness with a touch of dry caramel and crumbled cookies , though with only a light , restrained amount of sweetness . the simcoe hops serve up a fresh taste of citrus , particularly grapefruit , and a nice , spicy 'pop ' of white pine . moderate bitterness . finishes dry , crisp , and with some continued bitterness into the aftertaste . mouthfeel : medium-bodied . medium-plus carbonation . drinkability : i certainly enjoy the concept of a single hop series to really enjoy all the various vibrant nuances and characteristics of the particular hop varieties utilized . while this was previously done by bison , i had no love for the base beer used , so i quickly abandoned the idea of following that series . i 'm diggin ' this though

Review:

Review:

Review:
	poured into a sniffer glass from a 12 ounce bottle pours a moderate-sized head . color is a dark yellow/bronze . smells starkly bitter , almost to the tune of some very dry wines taste is almost like that of mead , with a definite honey presence . it 's taste is strong and very unique . i have n't had a beer quite like it . as it warms , the complexities become more apparent , which add to the flavor immensely . you have to give it to the sheer flavor of this beer , it 's very in your face , which is amazing if you like its style . however , i fear it may be too much for those who are on the fence about trying it for the first time my advise : if you 're into the extreme , this is definitely a beer for you . if you 're skiddish , i may suggest some easier brews .

Review:
	this is a pretty decent brew . ignore it 's recent trendiness , and just enjoy it for what it is : a clean , tasty , well made pale ale . pours a light amber/orange color , with a decent 2 fingers of head and some lacing aroma is a bit lacking , with notes of chemicals , subtle hops and raspberry iced tea . the flavor is initially steely and similar to your average lager , but then some hops join in and you get a decent bitter kick . aftert that , some honey joins in and some fruitiness and more hops on the finish . well balanced , but lacking in flavor . mouthfeel is slick and creamy , with decent carbonation . drinkability is high . i would have no problem with this as a sesher . overall , pretty good , but it seems like magic hat could truly make something spectacular out of this instead of dumbing it down for a mass audience .

Review:
	serving type - 22oz bottle appearance - dark as night , black oil , creamy thick 2 inch head , tons of lacing , o yes smell - roasted malts , oak , wood , chocolate , coffee , dark fruits , whiskey , cocoa , a little vanilla and alcohol also . taste - strong malty chocolate and <unk> start this beer out . lots of coffee flavors add the typical bitterness of ris 's . the oaked flavor is a mix of bourbon , vanilla and dark fruits like plum and rasin . alcohol warm in each drink , as is cocoa and roasted malts mouthfeel - big beer , mouth wrecker . tounge gets coated with malts , chocolate and alcohol . palette gets more malts , whiskey and some hop flavored dark fruits . aftertaste is a little bitter and alcohol warmth is still there . overall - just like every other yeti , this is fantastic . oaked flavor shines with the classic yeti chocolate/coffee flavor we all love . treat this session beer as it is , once a year crack it open and enjoy the special barrel aged goodness . must try for yeti , ris and oaked beer fans .

Review:
	( served in an american pint glass ) a- this beer pours a hazy golden orange body with a white head of big rocky bubbles . the carbonation is lots of big bubbles similar to soda pop s- the smell fresh green pine hops is strong with a note of caramel malt in the background . as it warms there is notes of citrus and more orange in the hops t-the initial taste is nice juicy green hops with hints of pine and very faint watermelon . this is followed by a nice malt flavor of caramel , biscuit and honey flavors . the finish has a nice hop bitterness that hangs on your breath . the finish has a slight dryness to it m- this beer has a medium-full mouthfeel with a slight creaminess from the fizz . the fizz is noticed more in the finish d- the hops were a big player but not punishingly big . there was good complexity in the malt , lots of nice soft layers give this beer good depth . i 've never tasted watermelon as a hop quality before but it is a positive one in this beer .

Review:
	thanks to edbeer for bringing this one out . 500ml corked and caged bottle . pours a semi-hazy burnt orange with no head , just a thin , tight white band around the bowl . nose expresses citrus rind , cork , a hint of spice and a trace of something sweet ; perhaps candi sugar . taste is much more muted than suggested by the nose . citrus prevails , as well as a medicinal quality . there 's also light fruit and toasted malt presence in the flavor profile . mouthfeel is light-medium with a slight acidity and minimal carbonation - not quite still , but close to it . overall , not a bad brew - a little dull for the style and definitely lacking in sweetness . alcohol is dangerously well-hidden . that said , i do n't see this beer improving much with age , so drink up .

Review:
	malt is a word that i 'd use to describe this bad boy pours with a nice head and is a dark brown with a bit of red/amber cast to it . i poured mine with a ton of head on it which lasted quite some time the first taste , i got a lot of foam and got hit with the malt then a bit of metalic taste . i 'm not sure about the metalic taste but it did n't come back for the rest of the glass . this is a big beer with a ton of taste and for those that are in to large malts , this is one to try .

Review:
	pours a dark brown/black with a thin rimming of tan head . smell has roasted malt , some chocolate and hints of coffee . taste is heavy with coffee and roast . like a roasted latte taste with some chocolate twinges . finish is a bit muddy , with a noticeable but kind of fleeting roasted after-taste . drinks very smooth . has a lighter body than most imperial stouts and the 8 % is n't there in taste at all .

Review:
	pours a beautiful dark reddish brown with thin off-white head and copious sticky lace . smells bready and yeasty with just a hint of caramel malt and faint chocolate . surprisingly , little in the way of raspberry aroma . smooth and creamy mouthfeel with prominent late carbonation taste is complex with typical brown ale caramel sweetness giving way quickly to overpowering tart raspberry and ending with a clean dry finish . alcohol is well masked by the tartness , but sneaks up on you quick . tartness is a bit out of balance and tarnishes other good flavors . a fine winter seasonal , sure to please beer afficionados and family members who like fruity concoctions as well . one by the fire is great , but i do n't think it would make a good session beer for me .

Review:
	poured into a .3 liter weizen glass . swirled around the last inch of beer to get the yeast active and top it off nicely . cloudy as a bavarian hefe weizen should be . the aroma reminds me of a distinctive clove smell . the taste is very nice , smooth yet not bland , phenolic flavor . compared to other bavarian weizens , this is not too far from the crowd but it doesnt get mistaken for something else . this helles weizen is a great beer for a hot summer day . refreshing to the last drop .

Review:
	on tap at the pub , 5 september 2009 . brought to the table with a good head still on it . standard deep amber colored body beneath an off-white head . slightly hazy . good head retention and lacing . the aroma delivers yeasty fruitiness , a wide <unk> base , and mild english hops . pleasantly surprising , the red eye is a malty english-style ale with a medium to slightly dark caramel malt base , a berry-like fruitiness from the yeast , and minty and leafy hops . a firm bitterness acts as ballast , and it 's tightly tied together and balanced i found it readily drinkable , and quite enjoyable . quite nice

Review:
	bottle from a mixed 12-pack from green 's on ponce in atlanta . pours one shade away from black with light brown highlights and a one-finger tan head . the head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving light lacing . smells of roasted and black malts with good hints of unsweetened chocolate . as it warms the black malt aromas come out a bit more . tastes similar to how it smells . black and roasted malt flavors up front are joined by hints of cocoa midway through the sip that disappear before a mildly bitter ending . mouthfeel is good . it has a solid thickness with moderate carbonation . drinkability is good . i did n't have a problem finishing the bottle and could have another . overall this was a solid schwarzbier and one that i would visit again . the flavors are n't as dark as others i 've had in the style and the flavors integrate well . worth a shot .

Review:
	i drank this from the bottle into a pint glass . the beer pours a medium to dark gold with a huge light tan head that rises about 3 fingers but does n't have great retention . tons of carbonation . lacing is ok . the aroma is light mostly some skunk with a little sweetness at the end the taste is light get a little sweetness but mostly weak hops and skunky . the feel is terrible its very light , almsot water-like . the beer is pretty drinkable overall , this is n't very taste but i ca n't believe its got 8.2 % abv . you would n't think it for a second . if you just want to drink something watery and get cracked this is the beer for you .

Review:
	this is my father 's version of a 'heavy ' beer , so he usually has some around when i go visit him . it does have an attractive pale yellow color , unlike some other macros that look too yellow for my tastes because they remind me of urine . it did have a slight aroma that was pleasant but faint . the taste is barely drinkable after it warms even a touch , so drink it cold if you must drink it . feels like carbonated water and the aftertaste prevents me from drinking very many of them . often times i pass on them when dad offers . in college we used to say 'any beer is better than no beer . ' i 'm not sure i can say that today .

Review:
	pours extremely dark , very close to black with brown head that disappears fairly quick . at initial pour roasted aroma pleasantly filled the air . roasted notes mix with a touch of chocolate and coffee . taste is similar to aroma . a touch of roasted dryness at first sip follows sweet aftertaste . a bit sticky mouthfeel , but overall it 's medium body . very smooth and i find it extremely drinkable honestly , i am not that familiar with porters to debate whether it fits the style . looking over bjcp guidelines , it seems to certainly fit the description for robust porter . now perhaps it 's the name of the style that misleading because certainly i do not find this beer robust ( the term creates an expectation of extreme roasted character for me ) . however , regardless of style or name , i find it drinkable and enjoyable .

Review:
	if i were marketing this , i 'd call it an oatmeal ale . it 's not a stout -- not thick enough -- but it 's certainly tasty . chocolate , coffee , and a lightly sweet finish ; medium-full body , decent head ( pours out of the bottle-neck like a lazy geyser ) ; lovely golden-brown color you ca n't always rely on price @ trader joe 's to point you to the good beers ; this one is among the cheapest they offer ( $ <unk> ) . this is a good barbecue brew . a pleasant surprise overall and a sleeper hit .

Review:
	poured into a perfect pint glass once i got off from work today . it was syrupy think coming out the bottle . pitch black with a moderate brown head that leaves a nice layer on top of the beer . coffee is the dominating smell and i love the pleasant rich and boldness . hints of brown sugar and molasses add some good sweetness to the aroma as well the beer provided a great conundrum for me , sweet black coffee . the coffee roastiness is more powerful than the sweetness , but it is still fairly balanced . the roastiness also provides a good bitterness in the finish . the mouthfeel is chalkier than i would have liked and a bit more creaminess would have helped . fairly easy to drink and one i would love to have most mornings for breakfast .

Review:
	hopped with galaxy and warrior hops . on the handpump . a : the dipa is a golden orange , hazed over , with a thick white head keeping it company . the head leaves strata of lace behind . s : the nose is hoppy , no two ways about that . thick citrus is plentiful and biting . the strength of the nose makes the ale seem like its been aged for a spell . t : as in the nose , the ale is very thick , treacly with hops . the citrus loses its way , too thick and heavy . the bitterness is bold and does n't subside , even if it ca n't be rationally described . the lack of carbonation is acceptable , settling down the hop body . a step towards the right direction . m : the mouthfeel is big and stroong , dominated by bitterness and thick flavors

Review:
	sampled at the 2003 pizza port strong ale festival . ( only on tap inside the restaurant ) you know a beer might be deadly if a brewpub is only selling it in 3oz and 6oz sizes . ( good price on those sizes too ) beer comes in a small taster glass with no head and is deep milk chocolate brown with ruby highlights aroma is of dark caramel coating raisins and plums . surprisingly , there is no discernible alcohol sensation in the nose . flavor matches the nose with long luscious strands of caramel wending their way around your mouth . before long the malt seems as narcotic as hops can be the finish strings into raisin and cherry fruits with a touch of roast , but finally as the beer passes to your throat that alcohol warming kicks in and traces a line all the way through .

Review:
	2011 vintage , foil wrapped 750ml into a dfh signature glass . a - pitch black body with a huge dark mocha head . tons of lacing and retention . looks pretty damn good . s - probably the best part of this beer . huge coffee/espresso presence . roasted malts , vanilla and milk chocolate . slight hint of alcohol . t - very smooth mouth feel . roasted malts , smooth coffee , and chocolate . not very bitter or alcoholic o - a good coffee stout , but certainly not the best out there . the smell was fantastic , but the taste really did n't stand out . perhaps i should have had this when it was fresher and the coffee was more prevalent . will seek out again next year

Review:
	looks like swamp water , the head is white and short lived . spice and citrus zest on the nose . pitch perfect acidity is the calling card of dark white . it sneaks in on the entry , but builds strength in route to the finish . its not funky or bretty or sour , this is the kind of acidity you get from a nice sauvignon blanc or champagne . it makes the mouth water . beyond the crisp acidity and beautiful finish . it has a light metallic note with good citrus character and lingering earthy notes . the finish is crisp and satisfying . sharp on the tongue . bright , refreshing , but full bodied . wow , talk about looks being decieving . no darker flavor notes at all , no real malt character . just a tremendous saison with a zip of acidity . fantome continues its excellence with this one .

	hello to my beer advocate family ! this is my 1st review and i got ta tell you from the gate ... i am an enjoyer ... not a reviewer ; but i will give it a <unk> ! picked up a 4 pack from beverage world today @ 16.99 dfh glass included ... woohoo ... love those free glasses ! put it in my kegerator for several hours to reach optimum temp . before cracking open . anyway since i am a lover of most big beers vs normal beers ; is there such a thing ? this one did not disappoint . enjoying now with some goodies i picked up from arthur ave . in da bronx ... bottled on <unk> ; got ta love dfh for that info . the nose is full of fresh malt and rum . the creamy light chocolate looking head was a little on the small side probably due to the lower carbonation mouthfeel of this brew , but it did leave nice sticky lace on my new beer clean dfh glass . my taste buds picked up raisins , lots of malt and a hint of vanilla.the ac came in midway ... well hidden for 12 % in taste but not the buzz . overall another tasty treat from one of my favorite brewerys

Review:
	appearance : poured with nice very creamy tan head that dissipated leaving nice lacing down my glass . the beer is clear with a very dark reddish-brown color that lets a little light through smell : sweet toasted malt , biscuit , sweet ripe berries and plums , woody oak , a little alcohol , and a very small dry peppery/earthy spice toward the end taste : sweet roasted malt , sweet plums and cherries , very small hoppy character , strong oak flavor , and a small metallic flavor . the flavors are a little bit light toward the end mouthfeel : medium-light body , a little bit watery for the style , nicely carbonated , a bit of a dry feeling , then leaves mouth pretty clean overall : great drinkability , very nice flavors . sweet dark fruit , roasted malt , and oak flavors are all very well balanced . it is a little thinner than i would like and there is a small metallic flavor but other than that this is a great beer ! wonderful character throughout .

Review:
	to be perfectly honest this is an average dunkel , fairly solid in all categories but average for the style . i have enjoyed this beer in the past and i continue to enjoy drinking some of these from time to time . pours very dark for a dunkel and produces a thick foamy head that ultimately turns to a thin film . minimal lacing slowly creeps down the glass and i am not able to determine the carbonation since i can not see through my glass . the aroma is malty , sweet , and bitter . i gave it a below average rating only because the aroma is very hard to detect , i 'm forced to shove my nose down into my glass in order to pick up any scent . the flavor is definitely based on the original lager , but it appears to be altered with some sweet malts . the combination is very good and i sure do enjoy the overall taste of this one . the mouthfeel is decent not too thin and the finish is clean and smooth . all in all a well rounded beer for this style .

Review:
	poured into a pint glass and received a one-finger head that stuck around due to carbonation . a mix between between copper and oragne is how i would describe the light , seethru body . a strong smell eminates , giving off a strong hop presence but also underlined by a small malt and bread presence with a hint og citrus . the beer has a ryeish , dry hop taste that contains earthy tones and is not very complex but good . balanced out by the malts for a refreshing , smooth ale that keeps you wanting more . i would n't session this beer , one or two is fine and perhaps i was a overly critical since i know samuel smith makes better beers .

Review:
	poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass . i aquired this beer in a trade with hyland24 a - looked like a glass of murky swamp water . it was a cloudy light yellow color with a finger or two of off-white head . not much light getting through at all . s - very yeasty , like country bread . i also got hints of ripe fruit ( banana ) and some citrus . t - lots of yeast up front , followed by a sweet almost <unk> flavor . it was n't like real bananna though , it was more like banana candy , like bananna now & laters , or laffy taffy . i also detected a tiny bit of citric bitterness in the finish . mf & d - the sweetness was good , but not overpowering and the flavor coated my mouth well . this beer came to me very highly touted , i would have to say it lived up to its billing . my only <unk> is having only 1 bottle to sample , i think this one would have gotten even better after a few more .

Review:
	making itself at home in my terrapin pint glass , <unk> cocoas ' chocolate porter is the color of <unk> ebony and is trimmed with mahogany-tinted garnet highlights at the periphery . a grainy-bubbled cap of soft khaki foam relaxes quickly into a soapy sheet too soft to leave more than token freckling of lacing on the glass . the smell is dark and chocolatey , with mild , smoky , near-burnt caramel and a lightly acrid whiff of charred grain . a tang of fruity , cocoa-dusted malt becomes stronger as the drink warms a bit . the taste is mild and milky with a touch of <unk> roasted <unk> , dilute unsweetened hot cocoa mix , and a dusting of bakers ' chocolate . the mild lactic sweetness is nicely accented in the finish by mellow , coffee-like bitterness , and a silky note of <unk> mocha drizzled in dark caramel lingers in the aftertaste . earthy , powdery-dry cocoa becomes much more prominent as the drink progresses . the drink is light-bodied and mildly carbonated and is really quite easy to drink . a nice , subtle beer that is very well-made and quite delicious .

Review:
	this beer is average in all <unk> with the exception of taste . this is an impressively clean tasting beer . the color is spot on , but the lack of head retention damages the appearance score . the smell is clean with the exception of some corn and cheap grains . the mouthfeel is as expected to style , but nothing to write home about . the drinkability is decent , a pretty nice , drinkable adjunct lager . a big plus is that this one does n't give me a headache after 3 , like some adjunct based beer .

Review:
	in honor of st . patrick 's day - 16 fl . nitro-can served in my sam smith nonic . poured with a cascading , creamy/frothy head that eventually coalesces into a two inch dense , tan-colored cap . head eventually settles into a solid one inch cap with thick sheets of lacing coating the sides of the glass and exhibiting excellent adherence . appearance is a dark brown with ruby highlights around the edges and when backlit . nose is subtle - dry with a hint of roast . taste follows nose , with the addition of an expression of light , toasted malt , a slightly watery quality and a metallic flavor that peaks out at the finish . mouthfeel is light-bodied , with the consistency of watery milk . pretty good drinkability for the style and really quite easy to session , although my preference is for guinness draught .

Review:
	the beer poured with a clear , golden color with somewhat creamy lacing on the sides but a generally thin head . aromas were a bit thin but had a nice touch of summery aromas including some apple , peach , pear mixed with hops . taste had that typical dry bitterness , but it was light and watery enough to make this a relaxing summer drink . a slight carbonated punch at the end of every sip , i could picture myself out on the deck of some restaurant drinking this with a nice meal . if only this new england summer did not suck . ah well . overall , a refreshing drink from harpoon .

	pours amber with a thick foam that has good retention with decent lacing all the way down . hoppy , some pine and citrus going for it . taste is similar , hoppy upfront with the citrus then going into a malt backing to balance it out mouthfeel is medium and creamy . drinkability is pretty good , the 8.3 % abv is n't noticeable and i could have another with ease .

Review:
	a nice lighter , somewhat sweet aroma with phenol present , with some spiciness . pleasant overall . pours with a big full chalk white head that laces alright . light gold to yellow and mildly cloudy . light overall flavor , lacking the dominace of flavors one would expect , such as citrus or coriander . wheat is a little light too . quite a bit more hop dryness than i noted in others of style . a little too sour . has a refreshing quality to it . average body . higher carbonation . not a great example of style , but if in point , worth a try . actually , it 's being promoted strongly , as it was n't that difficult to find in several areas of wisconsin . appreciate the brewery 's willingness to try something new and different .

Review:
	picked this up at <unk> market in so . thomaston , they had a few six packs of this sitting in the fridge so why not try one . pours a beautiful dark brown . though the smell is a bit odd , not sure how to nail it until i tasted it . this is different , a bit like dried fruit , sweet malt and licorice . mouthfeel is allright . overall drinkability ? well very different , not appealing at first although it seems like something i could like as i have five more of these . if so and edit of this will be on hand , but right now , this is just way different . after drinking the rest i 'm not too keen on the licorice flavor . this may be just a weird batch . i am willing to try this again .

Review:
	pours a mahogany brown with copper hues by the rim . light head subsides to a nice film and a rather thick collar . slight lacings a pleasant surprise . full chocolate malt nose , hearty with nicely toasted scents and a slight fruitiness ( raisin and date ) . reminds me of some simple dark sherries i 've enjoyed recently . light orangy hop notes . medium bodied with light carbonation . thick palate of milk chocolate , cocoa , toasted cocoa nibs , small amounts of cafe au lait , and a touch of tangerine hop influence . clean yeast profile with a slight mustiness inn the aftertaste . if there 's a coffee crusted filet with vanilla sauce somewhere in the world , this would work wonders to match . my thanks to himerman who sent me three bottles to enjoy ! bro , they went way to fast .

Review:
	i was not very impressed with the esb so i 'm a little hesitant of this one . i do like the dubbel though , so who knows . appearance - looks really good going into the glass . an amber colored beer that is brilliantly clear and very nicely carbonated which is feeding a nice constant head and gobs of lacing . aroma - some pine hops with a light touch of citrus . taste - a little harsh and piney up-front that fades into a nice malty wash . good bitterness in the finish that lingers . each sip is a flavorful transition from harsh and flavorful , to sweet and soothing , to bitter and anticipating . mouthfeel & drinkability - i think the body on this is really good for style , maybe a hair on the light side that keeps me hungry for the next sip . i am very impressed with this beer . this is definitely one of the easiest beers for me to drink . btw - the lacing just never gives up

Review:
	2006 vintage 22oz bottle , poured into a maudite snifter pours an amber-brown color with bright orange highlights when held up to the light . appealing aroma of sweet dark and caramel malts , dark fruit , and some brown sugar , along with a noticeable alcohol presence . palate is a rich and complex blend of malty sweetness , dark fruit , and brown sugar up front . a subtle hoppy bitterness emerges before the swallow and lingers long into the aftertaste , balancing things out a bit . notes of figs and prunes come through on the finish . body is velvety smooth , a great complement to the rich intermingling of flavors in the palate . very drinkable for such a strong beer , and the perfect accompaniment to a bowl of mushroom barley soup on a cold night . as usual , a wonderful offering from stone .

Review:
	from a fresh sixer of the 2008 offering . served at just over fridge temperature in an english imperial pint glass , and paired with sweet italian chicken sausages for dinner . appearance- pours a rich , deep clear copper with a terrific three finger head that remains like soapsuds atop the beer . this is a malty brew on the eyes alone ... reminds me of fuller 's esb with its depth of hue smell- sweet and malty , with a nose of cream soda ( subtle and <unk> , bordering on root beer ) . soft aromas that waft gracefully in the air . taste- sweet and bready , the malts carry this experience from start to almost the very finish ... it 's a consistent , and eventually predictable journey over the tongue . props for balance and elegance , as the final hop bitterness gently rounds out the malts and dries the palate mouthfeel/drinkability- the velvety texture is punctuated by a crisp , slightly aggressive introduction that livens the tip of the tongue . slick as it is in the mouth , the swallow is n't magical as it might seem . it 's an easy , drinkable beer that could absolutely be enjoyed one after another at the poker table .

Review:
	a : a hazy gold color with a huge pillowy off-white colored head . s : bready yeast aroma with some very strong alcohol , tropical fruit , and candy sugar . t : some bready , caramel malts with a strong alcohol flavor . tropical fruits and a faint concord grape in the background . a rather wickedly bitter aftertaste that shocks at first , but as you sip the initial shock wears off and mellows . m : peppery and high carbonation . a very dry/bitter aftertaste that mellows out after the beer warms . o : it 's a very good tripel . maybe a little too strong and dry for my tastes , but i served it too cold at first . when this beer warms it is fantastic , it opens up the flavors and they are excellent .

Review:
	has a nice brown hue with a decent head that leaves good lacing . smell is inviting with a hint of caramel and spice , more subdued than other winter warmers i 've sampled . taste is also lighter than expected but nice nonetheless . no real trace of alcohol but a good amount of hop is used to complement the spice and darker malt . mouth was smooth and retained good carbonation . not such a bad winter warmer but definately less complex than most . does n't have that 'piney ' or <unk> ' character that some may like , but i find this more drinkable than most as i 'm not a big tree taste fan ... unless its maple .

	2004 vintage : pours a murky mahogany with some ruby tint , and a thick , creamy tan head ... very nice especially for a cellared beer . the aroma is quite hoppy with big citrus ( tangerine , orange and lemon rind , grapefruit ) character , caramel sweetness , alcohol , toasted bread , and some esters . the flavor is quite hoppy initially with citrus and floral character , followed by some sweet caramel malt , fruity esters , alcohol and some toasted bread . while i enjoyed this beer , honestly it seemed too similar to their barleywine ( which is fantastic ) but i was expecting a much different beast than old ruffian and that is what this beer most resembles to me . the mouthfeel is chewy and rich and drinkability is good but the alcohol is somewhat warming . 2009 vintage : bottled on 11/19/2009 , ever so slightly less than a year old . pours a slightly hazy mahogany color with a thin tan head that retains ok . the aroma has a ton of sweet malts initially ( notes of caramel , bourbon , toffee , turbinado sugar ) along with some piney and citrusy hops in the background , along with some cocoa , pecans and almonds , dark fruits and some alcohol . the flavor has some citrusy and piney hops upfront ( but more muted compared to when fresh ) , along with caramel and toffee , rum cake , dark fruits , caramelized pecans , and some alcohol the mouthfeel is really smooth and drinkability is much improved . i 'm really digging this with a year on it , the hops have faded and the malts come to the forefront and the alcohol has really mellowed ... i 've got another bottle i 'll leave alone for a year or so to see how this one matures further .

Review:
	a - pours a clear copper-orange color with a finger of white head . the head fades down to a thin right around the outside leaving behind some lacing in the process . s - aroma is a mix of piney and citrus hops and sweet caramel malts . there is also some more background fruits mixed in as well . t - starts off with sweet caramel malt and some citrus hop in the background . there is some other fruity flavors mixing around . through the middle , some stronger citrus hops some though with a bit of bitterness . the finish is a mix of some stronger hop flavor and caramel malts that linger nicely . m - medium bodied with moderate carbonation . smooth and crisp . the finish is a touch dry and bitter and kinda nice . d - very drinkable . the flavor could have used a bit more punch ( especially a bit more hop ) , but there is still a nice balance throughout the beer . the light fruit flavors were a nice addition and could have been a bit stronger .

Review:
	1 liter , poured in aventinus glass , then poured again , and again ... . deep mahogany with a massive head demonstrating gradations of tan , slowly fell but left audacious , chunky clumps of lacing . sharp attack , nicely subdued chocalety sweet with dark bready smells . delicious rich blend of roasted dark coffee , faint chocolate , and hazlenut tastes -- <unk> . palate has fine carbonation full big malty richness like heaven . <unk> to delight in . i 'm very happy .

Review:
	a : nice amber color with a quarter inch of off white head that does not retain all that well . some lace . s : great rye notes ! very biscuity and the rye adds some spiciness . almost exactly like fresh bake rye bread . lots of carbonation rushes up from the glass and the hops provide a nice crispness . t : the hops come through a bit more when drinking . very crisp and herbal with a hint of pine as well . the rye flavor is spicy and bready but i think the hops overshadow them a bit . m : slightly boozy but pretty clean and crisp tasting . d : i could drink more but i think one is enough

Review:
	found at fitger 's , august '07 . this one looks a lot like coke with some cherry highlights . when held to the light , this baby glows . the head was but a little collar . smells of prunes and then some more prunes . this is accompanied by a slight astringent alcohol with a light raisin and a bunch of other dark fruits . the dark fruit emphasis seems to be lacking balance . tastes of sweet brown sugar , maple syrup and huge prunes again . a light roasted coffee fades in to finish it off . feels light and dense that amplifies the sweetness a good intro to belgian flavors , but way to sweet and fruity for my liking .

Review:
	2011 , beer camp # 8 . pours a clear golden orange color with a one finger foamy white head that quickly settles into a thin ring . minimal spots of lace left behind . slightly earthy aroma with hints of pine and grassy hops along with some sweet pale malt notes . hints of biscuit and light caramel along with some light fruit , especially apricot . fuller boded than expected and the hop presence is much stronger than the aroma suggests . earthy , floral and dry up front but only slightly bitter with hints of grass , pine and soil . this is countered by a sweet malt presence with hints of caramel , toffee , biscuit and faint nuttiness . crisp , well balanced and easy to drink with a dry , spicy hop finish .

Review:
	this is a pint glass of the new seasonal dunkel weizen served chilled . a : the ale is a hazy light brown color with a small head and no lacing . s : the ale has a bubblegum clove aroma that is quite sweet . t : the ale has the requisite clove and banana flavors that i 'd expect from a dunkel weizen but the beer seems to come just shy of being great . the flavors are too sweet . m : the mouthfeel is hurt a bit by the <unk> . d : very drinkable , but i 'll stick to the vintage list thanks .

Review:
	11.2 oz . bottle poured into my hoegaarden glass . a : a really nice color . a unfiltered golden that poured pretty flat without much carbonation . stills looks pretty darn good though . suspended yeast towards the bottom of the glass . s : wonderful aromas of orange peel & spice . much more aromatic then most wit 's i 've come across . t : a slightly tangy taste . the spices ( coriander , clove ) definately come through . the citrus flavor is also quite detectable . m : a refreshing mouthfeel ! the wheat flavor is really nice & dies off a bit toward the end to finish with a thinner feel .

Review:
	appearance : dispensed a light copper body , lightly hazed and capped with a finely-textured , white head . smell : aroma of pale malts with a hint of sugary caramel . the hops ( chinook , sterling , and cascade ) throw off notes of fresh florals , citrus fruits , and ( lightly ) pine . taste : pale malts with a modest amount of supporting caramel sweetness . hop flavors present fresh orange peelings , white pine , and humble meadow flowers . medium bitterness . a bit more maltiness prior to the bittersweet finish . mouthfeel : medium-bodied . medium carbonation . smooth mouthfeel . drinkability : a decent india pale ale out of jailhouse . any hopheads looking to receive a <unk> of hop character and bitterness will be left wanting , but those seeking a balanced ipa should be pleased .

Review:
	this might be another one of basil t 's year round brews . they did n't list this one in their beer menu , but the bartender told me that they had this one and it 's different from thier red ale . on tap on 3/8/08 and it was served to me in a pilsner glass . it poured a light clear amber that had a thin head of white foam that quickly dissipated into a handful of white foamy rings , one streak of white lace , and a few spots of lace . it had an unusual smoky aroma that contained green olives , wood , toasted malts , and a hint of caramel . then toward the bottom , the aroma started to get sour . what an odd aroma ! the taste started off faint with toasted malts and caramel . then halfway through , the taste all of a sudden became crispy with citrus hops and a slice of grapefruit . it was a light bodied beer that had a slightly malty and crispy aftertaste of toasted malts and citrus hops . it was just an average beer . i would n't mind ordering this beer again if it was the only thing they had .

Review:
	on-tap at clark 's ale house . appeared a lightly hazy straw yellow with a tall white head . i thought this was a nice american take on the style . while the flavor focuses on crisp malt and herbal spices while the aroma is filled with smooth floral hops that make a great compliment to the grassy and citrus yeast character . like hops and saisons ? give this a try .

Review:
	bottle was a 2006 gabf left-over that was given to me as a reward for my volunteer efforts . thanks a million to gabf and to backcountry for the opportunity . pours nearly a finger of white clingy head . dirty pale blah yellow . a little bit greenish color . not pretty . smells a little bit orange and hay . very mild and a touch metallic . tastes wet sweet . a touch grassy and some oranges . some sour tang . the sweet becomes a bit much . aftertaste show a mild and drying hop bitter . md body for the style and modest carbonation .

Review:
	thanks to mikesgroove for this extra this brew pours a light straw color and settles a haze infused yellow orange . 2 fingers of a chunky off white head sits forever.. the nose is clean and hoppy . fresh citrus , light pine , and a bit of caramel lingers . the taste is quite the same . some crisp , bitter offerings akin to grapefruit and pine . the malt bill is quite large but finishes with hop offerings easily applied . a sweet , buttered biscuit taste sits briefly and translates into a caramel taste . the mouthfeel is rich and creamy given the style . comes on flavorful and bold and ends crsip and a little dry overall , bomb ass ipa . full of flavor with a great nose and a smooth mouthfeel . pretty spot-on .

Review:
	i love the deep dark red of this beer , a near black cherry color with a tinge of mahogany . served in a tulip glass , it has a constant head and a champagne-like stream of co2 coming from its depth . this is a nice looking glass of red flemish ale . the aroma is sharp . the cherry is there up front , and underneath the malt . but there is also a small bit of acrid aroma that i ca n't quite place . sour cherry hits the palate first , with enough sweetness to keep it <unk> that fades away it becomes a little too sour . however , after about a minute or so , the finish is nice and malty . a strong start , a good finish , but an iffy middle . a good zip of carbonation keeps the mouthfeel lively , and a strong head gives a bit of a creamy texture . very nice indeed . if you 're a fan of flemish ale , this is a very nice beer . there are some things holding it back , but overall , a fine notch to put on one 's belt , so to speak .

Review:
	golden orange hazy color . white foam , average in compactness and creamy . at the smell some fruitiness ( orange ) , honey , some flowers . some spiciness , too . decent smell , but nothing remarkable . the taste is fruity , light honey , a bit sweetie . hints of spiciness here and there ( coriander , pepper ) . decent , drinkable , but surely not the best of the brewery . orange , orange flowers . quite drinkable . in the aftertaste flowers and some spices . less sweet . some honey again , less strong . white flowers , orange .

Review:
	poured into a tulip pours a slightly murky copper/brownish . rumors of undercarbed are greatly exaggerated ; this baby is flat as a fritter . nose - holy oak bombs batman ! some bourbon and alcohol coming in behind . taste - very sweet front end . caramel , maybe brown sugar . it 'd almost be too much if the oak finish did n't clean things up with a dry burst at the end lack of carbonation is so disappointing . this beer would be epic with even a hint of body . i 've force-carbed it at home and it moves from good to great . excellent beer , in spite of the carb issue , glad i 've got some to lay down and age .

Review:
	i feel lost abbey 's beers range from the sublime to the mundane . this beer had elements of both . the mouthfeel was incredible - had the velvet smoothness of an oatmeal stout , but also the effervescent acidity of a saison . bright golden sunlight in your eyeball - it was tantalizing . the aroma was lacking , almost nonexistent . wonder why either way this beer was very drinkable , and definitely would go quite well with some fried eggs or pommes frites .

Review:
	poured straight out of the refrigerator for a solid one inch tawny head that dissipated after 10 minutes or so . obsidian in color , and not giving light a bit of passage even when drawn out across the glass . intense , huge nose of sweet malty grains , like when my dad used to take me to the grain elevator as a kid as well as slight licorice notes and alcohol at the edges as well as caramelized sugar . in my haste , i sipped too soon and was rewarded with flat black coffee , anise , and some burnt notes ( my fault , not the beer 's ) . after patiently waiting for it to warm , i noticed my first impression was that the mouthfeel was somewhat lighter than i had expected , adding to it 's drinkability , but when i drink an imperial stout , i 'm generally happy after one and do n't mind a little extra viscosity . on the tongue it has a lot of heavily roasted ( burnt ? ) coffee and a tiny bit of sweetness giving way to some caramel notes and then back to the bitterness of baker 's cocoa that produces a drying effect on the <unk> wish the sweetness would linger somewhat as well . i would n't say i was dissapointed , as this is a quaffable stout to be <unk> just wish that some of the tremendous characteristics on the nose had carried through to the overall impression in the mouth .

	the beer poured a deep garnet color , with a minimal cream colored head . the head faded after a minute into a ring of foam around the edge of the glass . bits of lacing seen as the beer was consumed the aroma was a clean , bread and caramel affair . a slight toasted malt was noticed the taste followed suit , clean and simple . sweet malts , caramel , and a balancing bitterness . a tasty dark lager the beer had a decent carbonation and feel a decent beer overall . fairly easy to drink . i 'd probably have it again .

Review:
	appearance has a clear copper tone with a thin head and minimal head . smell of big piney grapefruit and malt in the back . taste has the same big piney grapefruit bitterness that lingers with sweet malt in the back . mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation . a lot of pine in this one , not bad , but just a different style of ipa .

Review:
	a - almost pitch black ... there are some garnet hues around the outside when held to a light . the head is thick and moussy coffee color with excellent lacing . s - mmm , intense hoppyness ... citrusy , perfumey hops . t/m - full bodied with moderate carbonation . complex , but not as hoppy as the aroma would suggest . the malts are a bit darker and more to the forefront than in a traditional ipa . there is a little roastyness and sweetness , but the hops still make their presence known . so , it 's not a traditional ipa . it is still a great beer .

Review:
	presentation : 22 oz brown bomber , & # 8220 ; unfiltered and unpasteurized , please refrigerate & # 8221 ; on the label . no freshness date . appearance : bold orange amber colour with a mild chill haze , big frothy cream coloured head nearly over flows and seems to stick all over the glass . smell : big time coriander with a floral hop in the back , fresh oranges with a hint of ester . taste : very creamy medium body with a luscious and smooth carbonation . a full and rounded sweetness with flavours of coriander and citric rind riding out its wake . hop bitterness is quite noticeable but not harsh , more of a pungent flavour that tries to meld with the fruitiness . estery alcohol flares a bit with fruity and mild solvent flavours . a tight spiciness opens up in the middle with a quick peppery note and a bite from the hops as well as a meek medicinal phenol that rounds the brew out . an underlying nuttiness from the yeast adds an other complex bite to the every growing hop flavour that is bothersome and oddly attractive at the same time . notes : this brew reminds me of some of the new upstarts in belgium and their generous use of hops in traditional styles as well as their own . a good paring would be with a plate of assorted pungent soft cheeses with whole grain rye crackers and fresh orange wedges to break up the flavours .

Review:
	had a bottle recently at a friends house . appearance : poured into a 1/2 mass glass krug . came out with a nice deep red with a bit of lighter ( orangy ? ) tones . 2 finger head that quickly disappeared with minimal lacing . smell : slightly sweet with a hint of grains . overall a quite pleasant aroma . taste : light taste with a decent sweetness . the taste seemed to match the smell as it was n't too sweet and had a decent grain aftertaste . mouthfeel : slightly thick with perhaps a bit too much carbonation . drinkability : good beer ... not great , i liked it fine but thought it might have needed a bit more of a roasted taste . i would not go out of my way to find this but also would n't turn one down if offered again .

Review:
	this brew is the ladera ranch entry into the backstreet brewing <unk> experiment ' in which the three brewers we given matching quantities of fermentables , hops & spices , and the same white labs belgian yeast strain . this one pours a deep copper capped with a dense collar of tan foam with outstanding clarity . entry is smooth with a subdued level of carbonation allowing orange peel and the belgian yeast to shine . mid-taste begins with a deep malt presence combined with complex spiciness . the finish is dry and <unk> between the distinct yeast and malty spices . mouthfeel is full without chalkiness and finishes dry . without a doubt , my favorite of the three experimental beers .

Review:
	a couple days with grecian wines proved satisfactory enough , however for the eve before the wedding of yours truly i was delighted to find some semblance of hops at the wine restaurant in fira , santorini in this finely crafted ale . a deep amber hue with a modest haze gives the impression of rich pale ales or english mild ale . light lace was a sight for sore eyes after looking for the same with their famed white wines and desert digestives . an british-like demeanor chases this beer from the early nose of yeast fruits , hearty caramel malts , and spicy hops until its earthy linger of lupulin , nutty grain , and mild attenuation in finish . apples , pecans , toffee , biscuit all weave into an <unk> culmination that 's balanced by the earthy bitterness of grass and spice from noble english hops- slight fruity with orange zest and grapefruit carry a challenger hop character that might remind me of citrusy american hops . well melded sweetness takes the shape of mild ripe tobacco as the floral character of hops complement the bold malts . thirst quenching and satisfying , this was a great find on the greek isles .

Review:

Review:
	on tap at the bel air location the other day . the beer pours a honey amber color with pretty good head retention and lacing . the nose is sweet and spicey , focusing on clove and brown sugar in abundance . given the fairly intense aroma profile , i was a bit surprised and disappointed by the modest amount of flavor i got on this moderately ( at most ) sweet frame . i thought it was still pretty nice beer , but given how it smelled , i just expected more . mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly smooth ( almost all the beers i sampled at duclaw were a bit under carbonated , which i 'm sure affected the mouthfeel ) , and drinkability is pretty decent nothing mind blowing here , but this was a decent enough beer , especially considering the low abv . i would n't mind seeing a bit more spice and hoppiness on the palate , but other than that , this was n't bad at all .

Review:
	this is a great belgian pale , and is a bit surprising . has a cloudy rust color with a head that keeps itself a live for some time . smells surprised me the most , with a major citrus scent and some follow up of belgian yeast strains . it has the taste that i can really enjoy however , with just a bit of the hops and sweetness but major belgian yeast flavor mixed with a citrus flavor i love unibroue and their brews , and this is second in line to the trois pistols . re fermentation

Review:
	one-off 22floz bottle review from notes taken the 8th of june 2007 . the label indicates that this was 'bottled conditioned in 2006 . ' appearance : the modest head develops holds up alright , and sticks along the glass 's side . murky body is a shade darker than school bus yellow-orange . smell : a hop concoction of fruity esters ( pineapple and grapefruit ) and floral attributes ( a light touch of wild flower aroma ) taste/mouthfeel/drinkability : this will be done through a list of <unk> words -- <unk> , tangy , mouthpuckering , full-bodied , tart citrus , grapefruit bitterness , and honey nectar . dunno if that simplifies things ... but for me it works . mighty tasty ! probably would go well with certain foods and smelly cheeses . smutty does n't dissappoint as it does a good job at brewing a dipa .

Review:
	33cl bottle , pours a crystal clear burnished orange which flickers in between apple juice ruby and sunset brilliance , three fingers of foam pile on top and simmer down to a thin layer that leaves gobs of lacing down the glass . lazy spirals of bubbles surface to maintain a solid layer of fine bubbles . spectacular looking . nose is ripe with fruity esters , loads of apples , strawberries , a hint of spice . alcohol comes out initially and gives it a boozy feel but easily dies down as it warms to give the smell a warm fullness . first sip you 're struck by the thick boozy esters but after an acclimatization and a warming minute or two , the full glory of this beer comes out . appley esters , full graininess , light cloves almost peppery spiciness , grassy and lemony bitter finish , a thin candy sweetness winds its way . the best thing about this beer is the mouthfeel . thick without being syrupy , beautiful carbonation - it just rolls around your mouth . perhaps not a belgian ipa and perhaps a little on the boozy side , especially initially , but at 10.5 % we can be a little forgiving . this is a finely crafted beer that , despite my overall hesitancy with tripels , i would enjoy having regular access to .

Review:
	my opinion is unfortunately tainted because of my love for all things bitter . with that said , i do n't know why there are a certain few that ca n't stand this beer . i would think it could harbor a mediocre review on style compatibility <unk> this is an apa and <unk> as such . i , of course , think that it 's the best thing in a can that is out there , and one of my favorite hoppy brews overall . if you like hops , then this will double the size of your hop head . sure it 's unbalanced , but that is the appeal of the apa- an overhopped ipa . am i right ? and to validate my opinion , i had this beer on a <unk> recomendation of a liquor store owner on my visit to the <unk> i 'd never even heard of it before then . so , hyped or not , from a one hop lover to the next , buy a six and enjoy .

Review:
	coming in a 12 oz . brewmaster 's collection brown bottle with a freshness date of may 2005 , the cream stout poured dark brown and opaque with red highlights at the edges . the head was very thick , brown , and craggy . needless to say , lacing was very nice as well . the aroma was mildly roasty with a whiff of graininess . the taste was better than the aroma suggested , with dry , creamy , roasty , chocolaty , and coffee flavors swirling around . this was very soft , and a little bit thin on the tongue . smooth and easy to drink , but lacking in a lot of complexity .

Review:
	had a bottle of this yesterday at a family gathering . not a bad beer at all . in fact if was pretty good . pours the standard cloudy , medium golden color of all other wheat beers i have seen . has an initially very nice thick white head that sticks around for a bit , but not too long . left some nice lacing in my glass though . smells are primarily of citrus , perhaps a touch of lemon , some wheat/grains , and a bit of spice . not very strong aromas overall . tastes fairly sweet with citrus , lemon and some mild spiciness hitting the palate first , followed by some wheats and malts . moderate carbonation makes for a nice crisp mouthfeel . very easy to drink . now that i had one of these for free i think this may indeed be worth buying . a very good , solid offering here from the boston beer company indeed

	gold appearance , crystal clear . head is light and without body , gone in 20 seconds . practically no lace to speak of . really have to work hard for an aroma , palest corn syrup . the flavor is somewhat better , shows some malted milk qualities with carbonation that works decently side-by-side . finishes with inadequate hops and a little too much residual sugar sweetness . mouthfeel and drinkability are decent , a throw <unk> back macro style of beer for a camping trip or tailgating .

Review:
	bottle : poured a deep black color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention . aroma of bitter roasted malt is quite powerful . taste is dry , i would even say too dry for my own taste , with a long bitter finish and a strange yeast taste that does n't mix very well with the rest . body is above average and alcohol is well hidden . can not say i was overly impressed with that one and i ca n't see what everybody is raving about . well , i will go back to their blonde and brune which i enjoyed a great deal more .

Review:
	this beer tastes like vomit . no really , it actually tastes and smells like fresh vomit . that might sound rather harsh , but it 's the truth . i struggled through one of these , hoping at some point my palet would adjust to something that i was missing , but no , it just kept tasting like actual vomit . i do n't really know what else to say , when a beer tastes this terrible the appearance and texture do n't really matter . epic failure .

Review:
	appearance : poured with a nice light tan foamy and bubbly head that dissipated over a couple minutes leaving lacing at the top of my glass . the beer is very clear orange gold color smell : sweet caramel malt , citrus hops , sweet flowers taste : sweet caramel , sweet citrus orange and grapefruit hops , flowery flavor , small hop bitterness , and roasted malt . pretty nice balance of sweet and bitter , a bit on the sweet side though mouthfeel : medium bodied , slightly syrupy , with nice carbonation , ending with a small bitter bite on the tongue overall : pretty easy to drink , a bit sweet , gets slightly boring since it is just sweet and hoppy ... not much subtleties . alcohol not noticeable .

Review:
	flying dog doggie style , on tap at mellow mushroom , charlottesville , va , 01/11/09 . served in a traditional american pint glass . appearance : comes a transparent orange amber with sparse , infrequent carbonation.. arrived without a head , though there was a thick sheen of snow atop with some thin , delicate solid sheets of lace . the sheet-like nature of it all does n't remain long , but there 's still plenty of sticky , clingy , stained <unk> lacing . aroma : very biscuity , crisp , caramelized malts and a handful of herbal hoppyness . simplistic , but pleasant . taste : very neutral , with herbal , lightly minty , faintly tobacco-y hops resting atop a sea of dry , well-attenuated , roasted malts . bitterness is mild to moderate . it 's just a largely mild , inoffensive , nondescript brew . mouthfeel : medium bodied , with a slight , dry , subtle crispness that results from a mild and fine-bubbled effervescence . drinkability : similar to the last brew i tried ( the brooklyn pennant ) , this one 's a straightforward , inoffensive , <unk> flavorful pale ale . there 's nothing wrong with it , it 's just not terribly impressive or bold . the alcohol 's right though , and at mellow mushroom the price is always right , so i do n't regret buying it at all .

Review:
	beer review from ba mag aug 2007 . released in 2002 , this was apparently australia 's first 100 percent certified organic beer and boasts that it is <unk> hopped . ' unfiltered , we opt to decant carefully and allow it to pour a bright , very clear pale golden brew topped with a rocky white foam head that shows great head retention . pale malts , rhubarb and floral , fruity esters , with suggestions of caramel sweetness . incredibly smooth on the palate , surprisingly medium-bodied and round -- almost a bit chewy , with a kickass foundation of fresh pale malts . sweet , but not overboard , with toasty , caramel malts providing depth . the carbonation emerges from the body and provides a gentle crisp edge , with a semi-floral hop character and fruitiness that follows . residual caramel notes and a toasty sweet linger in the finish . by today 's standards , this leans more toward being a full and malt pale ale as opposed to an ipa ; but as it stands , it 's a tasty organic offering from down under -- it 's just not an ipa . not even close . more hops , please .

Review:
	this beer is and was amazing . i have never tasted a beer that was this fruitful . usually a beer does n't have a flavor that is this pronounced . the only way that i can relate this beer is to think of it as maraschino cherries . the beer also does not have a major aftertaste . but the aftertaste it does have is much like the overall taste .

Review:
	i had this on tap at naja 's in redondo beach ( served in a pint , $ 7 ) . the beer was murky copper color with very little head . the smell was very west coast hops , lots of grapefruit and some pine needle resin mixed together . the taste is aggressive with afore-mentioned hops while having a serious amount of malt thrown in for balance . this is comfortably a dipa , but it rides the line close to barley wine territory . the body is fairly thick making this seem a significant beer , easy for me to finish the pint but it forced some nursing .

Review:
	served from a can , brought back from trip to the brewery in wisconsin . color was cranberry pink , with a light pink foam . smelled sweet , like blackberries ( like the label says ) . taste was sweet and fruity , did n't have much a of a beer taste at all . reminded me of drinking a cream soda ( the carbonation felt like a soda pop ) . if you do n't like typical grainy beer flavor , this would be a good one to try . i give it high marks because it is what it claims to be - fruity , flavored , and not masculine . no suprises , pretty much what i was expecting .

Review:
	a tasty brew courtesy of number1bum . cheers josh appearance : an easy pour from the can into my new shorts glass ( thanks stef ! ) , the beer is a clean , clear golden bronze color . there 's plenty of white , foamy head on this bad boy , at least an inch and a half . the lacing is most impressive , heaps of thick sticky foam clinging to the sides of the glass . smell : fresh and surprisingly bitter and hoppy with just a little bit of sweetness balancing everything out . taste : not as hoppy as the smell would indicate , but the hops are still there . the hops are a bit peppery and remind me of grapefruit that ai n't quite ripe yet . the bitterness really likes to hang on too , not really leaving a clean finish . mouthfeel : nice medium body , plenty of carbonation , pretty much what you would expect for the style . drinkability : not a bad drinking pale ale . it has some nice hops to it , and a sessionable abv . this beer is really at home on a cool summer night . i 'd definitely recommend it , thanks again josh

Review:
	bb <unk> , served chilled in a pilsner glass . a : pours a dark straw hue , lively carbonation full of tiny bubbles , topped with a cottony white foamy head with ok retention . s : a pretty decent level of <unk> comes before a mildly floral-hoppy note and the decent sweet <unk> note of a well-lagered beer , while a swirl wakes up a mildly doughy touch . alas , apart from these the aroma has nothing else to show . t : rather tart-fruity upfront , a bit like starfruits , with a syrupy touch of malts , then being taken over by a rich flavour of bitter-sweet , honey-ish and faintly <unk> lager malts that has a semi-chewy toasty element to it . finish is decently bitter-sweet , added with a touch of dried grass in the hop bitterness . m & d : quite refreshing , somewhat lacking the weight for a 6 % abv . beer and also a tad watery in the finish , but overall easy drinking . imo , this beer needs a slightly heavier maltiness for a decent gravity , but the soothing aftertaste of bitter-sweet hops seems to elevate the whole performance a bit . not bad , albeit simplistic .

Review:
	canary gold with suspended yeasties . served way too cold ; warmed to room temperature over an hour or so . slow <unk> bubbles . modest head , fantastic lace . nose is full of cracked pepper and tart and spicy yeast phenols . buttered bread lurks underneath . powdery malt . open yeast packets . taste is much better than nose , fulfilling many requirements of the style ; dry , tart , semi-sweet , with a lingering bitterness . coriander , <unk> malts . grain flavor lingers . love this beer except for the lingering nutrisweet flavor that pops in and out . goes down pretty well , though there is a slight orange-rind astringency i do n't particularly care for . drinks well - you could stick with this one your meal and beyond .

	on tap at the brewpub - december 27 , 2010 . pours a dark brown color with a good tan head that leaves behind a bit of lacing and sticks around for awhile . the nose is really nice and chocolatey . really love the level they 've used . under that , a bit of roasted malt but this was mostly about the chocolate . the taste is n't quite as nice , though the chocolate notes really still stand out . the feel was quite nice with a full body . pretty viscous for what it is . drinks quite well . i 'm a big fan .

Review:
	poured a ruddy brown , no haze at all . off-white head formed and very slowly receded to lace . smell is chocolate and caramel malts , hint of noble hops . malty sweetness is very prevalent . the taste hits with chocolate malts at the beginning , then a bit of sweetness , and fades with a decent noble hop finish . something is n't quite right with the hops , but i can not put my finger on it . it is n't unpleasant , it 's disconcerting ; it 's not right , but it is n't dead wrong , either . just odd . mouthfeel is smooth with a bit of dryness in the finish . very drinkable . will certainly wash down the dryest of chimichangas .

	the beer looks great -- a nice , deep brown with a fine head . the aroma screams dunkelweizen ; the banana , clove , and sweet malt notes are all at the fore . a sip of this beer , however , reveals some big problems . the main one is the level of sweetness . to be sure , german wheat beers typically have a sweet , fruity element to them . but franconia winter wheat has a heavy , overwhelming sweetness that sets into the tongue and obscures its other facets . it is n't that the beer is n't 'to style ' -- i do n't really care about that -- but rather that it has none of the balance and craftsmanship that i detect in franconia 's three flagship brews . the modest hop bitterness -- which , in a well-made beer , would suffice -- here collapse under the unwieldy syrupy-sweet mess . those last four ounces were tough to finish . i want to be a fan of every beer from this brewery ; my heart is open , so to speak . that 's probably why i was so disappointed . franconia can do better than this , and in a year 's time , i 'll revisit this beer to see if any improvements were made .

Review:
	clown shoes blaecorn unidragon 22 oz bottle into snifter pour is opaque with a massive mocha colored head that took its time to sink into a wisp atop . some nice lacing around the sides of the glass . aroma has hints of licorice , brown sugar and molasses with enough espresso and cocoa to go around . some pine-like hops balance things out nicely . nicely hopped , somewhat agressive with lots of pine and some grapefruit rind . coffee and dark chocolate are present in the flavor with some anise lingering about . no trace of the 12.5 % abv which is very surprising . excellent offering . reminds me a bit of goose island 's <unk> with the abundant hopping . ca n't believe it clocks in at 12.5 % abv , hardly a trace of it in the flavor . well done .

Review:
	picked this up over christmas . have n't gotten around to drinking it till now , in march . absolutely lovely looking beer . pours out a clear walnut color with a good finger of foam topping it , frothy and lasting . smells pleasantly malty with nice notes of vanilla . extreme vanilla-bean flavor , overwhelming everything else . i consider myself a fan of vanilla . but this is just too overwhelmingly vanilla . no subtlety , no craft such promise , such failure . i ended up pouring about half of the beer down the drain .

Review:
	22oz bottle into a snifter . this was an extra from a kind trader , and something i 've never tried before . the beer pours a black with off-white head . there are touches of brown and red in the mix . the head quickly subsides and does n't leave much lace . the beer smells strongly of bakers chocolate with a touch of coffee and even some dark fruit . there 's also some noticeable booze , but it 's nothing horrible . i 'm also getting a touch of sourness , but this is n't infected - more of an acidity from the roast . the taste is really strong roast with some nuanced complimentary flavors and a bit of booze . there 's a nice touch of hop bitterness as well . but the focus is on the chocolate and coffee flavors , backed up with a sweet malt base . there are some notes of fig and prune , plus some licorice that give this depth the beer has a thick body and low carb , <unk> in it coming across as a touch syrupy . there is some lingering roast in the finish and some sweetness . this beer is decent and enjoyable , but southern tier choklat blows it out of the water .

Review:
	received in trade with cooperrip thanks again . bottle states <unk> spring 2006 <unk> served a bit below room right into a nonic . tan head rose and fell and lingers on the surface . the body is black oily and completely opaque . smells is robust , salty , smoky , earthy , maybe some brown sugar , dirty coffee hints of caramel and that slight anise character typical in some ris , but subtle and perfectly executed . taste is big , chewy , meaty , yet immediately approachable . i get an excellent roasted flavor , colored by a nutty character that makes it sort of pop in my mouth . bitterness is perfectly balanced definitely not as aggressive as some , but provides tasteful ballast . mouthfeel is wonderful , well balanced , surly and big , yet so tasty and easy to drink . this great offering starts aromatic and tasty and ends in very welcome alcohol warmth . i am very pleased to have had this <unk> brew . great companion on a cold night , a simply great brew from a great brewery . god i wish i could get a case and do as they <unk>

Review:
	12 oz bottle . thanks to splitgrin for hooking me up with this one . enjoyed mostly at approx . cellar <unk> n't even attempt to drink this straight out of the fridge . the first couple sips i had were too cold for this to show it 's true character . pours a very dark , muddy <unk> head . oak , vanilla & burnt cocoa aromas surge from the glass . flavor has it 's share of dark chocolate ( a ton of it actually ) , vanilla , and <unk> the noticeable oaky bourbon flair of course . the alcohol is not shy in this brew , and you can definitely pick it up with every sip . <unk> be a bit more thick and not hurt my feelings much . if you 're a sucker for dark chocolate and/or like bourbon-aged beers , then you need to find this somewhere .

Review:
	pours dark amber with almost white head . nose is caramel sweet , with a suggestion of black tea aromas . palate is caramelly sweet but not heavily sweet , and light in flavors of cinnamon , nutmeg , and overall malty sweetness . this is a very light version of a winter beer , as far as winter beers go , normally . however , i think this wheat lager was clearly intended to be this way . easy drinking .

Review:
	when i began homebrewing about 15 years ago , i needed bottles . bass was my beer of choice to accomplish the mission . no need to buy bottles with nothing in them , right light honey/caramel , orange-yellow color . head is very dense , very thick , and keeps going until the end of the beer . smell is a nice blend of sweet and <unk> with the hops edging out by a bit . taste was a bit mild-mannered . some creamy sweetness that moves more towards hop toward the end . malt flavors were mild and the hops stepped out a bit more . bordering on thin and low carbonation . i 'll give the drinkability just over average , because it 's not unpleasant , nor bad , just not awesome .

Review:
	an orange tea colored brew with a goodly foamy head and decent bits of lacing throughout . a fairly unique aroma of barbeque malt and piney hops , very palatable blend . the taste is a nice mellow mouthful of creamy malt and earthy hops , again , nicely and uniquely blended with a tasteful hint of alcohol at only 5.5 % . some deep toffee tones are there as well , almost butterscotch sweet . very drinkable , meekly carbonated but very nice body . a dry bitter finish follows . i like this one and will recommend to all

Review:
	bomber into goblet on 12/19/08 , courtesy of deuane a - medium amber/light copper-colored body with half a finger of off-white head and modest carbonation . head flared up to a fluffy cap with each swirl of the glass . s - huge west coast nose with piney and grapefruit hops supported by caramel malt . big pungent hop nose . t - extremely aggressive hoppy character for a plain old ipa with plenty of pine , resin and citrus hop bitterness . there 's also a bit of sweet caramel malt present , but the hops definitely reign supreme here m - medium body with oily texture and a dry , bitter finish that lingers on the palate for quite a while d - man , this was hoppier than some ipas i 've had in the past . this one 's bitter , so pucker up

Review:

Review:
	pous out of the rocket widget bottle with a vengance . a lovely dark , dark brown head , that lovely smell that is guiness . it really is an old friend . strange to review it really 'cause <unk> been drinking it for 30 years . still sometimes the review is simply a way of expressing oneself . from the bitter to the coffee ; with that creamy smooth feel in the mouth . why can some macros do it and others ca n't ? i have often said aftertaste is my big thing . well , guinness has good aftertaste . guinness draught is one of the reliable ones when it comes to beer . in those airport bars , chain hotels , etc . you can always be sure with this brew . there may be better beers out there but never forget your old friend or you 'll grow old alone .

Review:
	a nice showing from the get go here . super fluffy beige head with gloriously artistic <unk> nice legs on this one eh ! deep in the nose with an over-abundance of malt syrup and caramalized pear . the mouthfeel continues in the malt syrup direction , yet proves to be more enjoyably rich than flabby . more malt and sweet pear in the mouth . man this is a real fun beer to warm up to ! the concentration of malt , and the subtle entrance of fruit in the way of roasted pear , tart cherry and red berry make for a complex taste experience . pretty to the end with washes of vanilla and bittersweet hop . i 'd love to be on this pirate <unk> during a storm maybe ! finishes moderately candied and <unk> your reviews for spelling to see if your not quite buzzed and beginning to make errors

Review:
	22oz bottle into tulip pint . a - pours a clear , but fairly dark amber with an off-white head that has fair retention and some light rising carbonation . s - very strong bread upfront with some faint hop bitterness to the finish . t - more fresh baked bread with some very lightly roasted malt as well as more light almost herbal hop bitterness in the finish . m - medium to full body , with good carbonation . d - a nice change of pace with a very bready backing and unique flavor , though still very approachable and easy to enjoy . this is my first of this style , though i was able to pick up the tea-like hop flavor mentioned in the style description .

Review:
	being a relative rookie when it comes to imperial ipa and quality beer in general , i ca n't help but think that maybe maharaja has spoiled me . looks beautiful served on draft in a small brandy snifter . looks like a burnt orange to me . the smell is amazing - a wonderful combination of citrus hops and some other fruity sweetness that i ca n't really place . the taste is probably even better than the smell . it 's a perfect balance of hops and malt i lack the beer vocab to truly do maharaja justice , but i 'll just say it 's a fantastic beer and the best ipa i 've ever had to date . my only complaint is that i did n't discover this beer years ago . i could drink way too many of these .

Review:
	produces a great three finger sized crown of light tan cranium that dwindles down and stays about a finger thick through the whole serving in a chimay chalice . awesome lacing , and has a dark ruby reddish copper colored body that is pretty hazy . the aroma is yeasty and grape upfront , then floral , sweet molasses and fig . this does finish up with an herbal/metallic characteristic . upfront in the taste are figs and cherry , and the honey is detectable . this beer also reminds me of a german lebkuchen as well . this has feelings of a <unk> appeal . local 2 has all the traits to make it a great beer in its style category .

Review:
	12 oz . bottle with no freshness date ; the cap states this is a solar powered brewery . the ale poured a yellow , goldish color with a very slight haze . the head was nice and white , about 1/4 inch . it dissipated rather quickly leaving very little lacing . it has a looks a lot like anchor liberty ale . a very fruity , tangerine like odor gave the impression of beer freshness the initial taste is of slight bitterness and carbonation followed by a fruity backbone . it appearance gives one the impression that this may be a light pale ale version ; it is not . it is rather substantial in flavor . it is little too carbonated for me , though the sweet aftertaste on the tongue is welcoming this one is better than i thought and more flavorful . the ale was quite expensive and really should have a freshness date . at 5.5 abv and its balanced flavor , it would make a decent session ale .

Review:
	bonus bottle from <unk> bro pours dark gold with a heavy chill haze , and a half-inch head of white foam . retention is moderate and a few streaks of lacework appear for the duration . aromatics are a blend of biscuity malt , pine sap , citrus fruit , and pineapple skin . not incredibly pungent or floral , but square on and crisp for a standard ipa . medium bodied , drying and minerally crisp . dried citrus fruits and spruce on the pallet . some lightly toasted malt follows through and a smidge of warming alcohol . drying and firmly bitter with a chaulky nod . finishes with pineapple skins , biscuit malt , and mild grapefruit with apricots . tasty enough , and this ones seeming pretty fresh . i 'd have another one

	a- very dark read , almost no head and minimal lacing . s - bready , some hops , dense fruit t - carmel , solid malt base , booze , washed over with pretty decent hop flavor . m - carbonation could be higher , as well as possibly a thicker body . maybe appropriate for style , it 's just my opinion . d - had my ups and downs with shark bite . loved it , then hated it . last two attempts were nasty . the only time i liked it was on tap . i thought this larger version might be the ticket . while it is bigger , boozier and hoppier , it is still flatter than i like and not nearly as carbonated . glad to try , though .

Review:
	my buddy brought this back from a trip with his brother down south . i enjoyed it a lot even though i am not a regular stout drinker . a - huge tan creamy head on top of a super black viscous liquid . s - lots of roasted malt - coffee , chocolate , some caramel . some bourbon and oak in the back of my nose . t - a lot of bourbon up front with coffee bitterness on swallow - the bourbon completely overwhelmed any more subtle flavors on the first sip . as you adjust to the bourbon , the roasted malt flavors appear . m - thin with high carbonation - probably my least favorite part of the beer d- nice sipping beer . i picture drinking this on a warm summer evening at a pig roast eating pulled pork . the bourbon finish is tasteful , the burnt faint background brings depth to the beer . very enjoyable beer .

Review:
	pours a straw colored , hazy golden yellow with a vibrant foamy white head of big carbonation quickly dissipating leaving little lacing in the glass . the fresh , pleasant hop aroma wafts from the glass featuring floral scents and citrus zest . also a hint of straw or grass , and just a touch earthy . big floral hops , wheat & yeast , perhaps just a hint of pepper , and lemon or similar citrus flavor . generous carbonation , light to medium bodied , and a great palate . this is a great beer for everyone . enough flavor for the true beer lover , but no so aggressive it turns away the novice . also , extremely easy to drink a few

Review:
	not a great fan of the style itself but it delivers well on the stone taste you get in all of the brewery 's beers . it 's a little too hoppy to be considered a straight belgian strong but a great california style clone of the style . would recommend . this has turned into one of my favorite beers and is also very reasonably priced . i will be bumping up some of my numbers .

Review:
	pours a deep amber , with a tan head that quickly vanishes . aroma was mostly of sweet malts , with hint of vanilla and some spice the taste is a pretty balanced one . sweet malts stand out . a bit of a vanilla taste as well . a very slight bitterness rounds everything off . very well balanced . extremely drinkable . winter solstice goes down smooth and easy . ready for another one .

Review:
	2010 bottle , served cool in a st . b goblet . a casual pour yielded a finger of light beige head situated atop a cloudy brown liquid the color of cider in the fall . the head faded fast leaving little to no lacing . the aroma was rich with sweet malt , candied dark fruit and an earthiness that invoked images of being outdoors in a forest . the taste followed the nose closely - figs and plums , sugary sweet malts and a slight spiciness with a light alcohol finish . the mouthfeel was pleasant . it was full bodied , with medium ( but pronounced ) carbonation . overall it was a very satisfying beer to sit and slowly enjoy .

Review:
	thanks to natasharai for giving me an opportunity to try this huge beer a : almost a finger of tan head with a very aggressive pour . pitch black with light brown only visible in the light . some retention but no lacing . s : coffee beans , bitter chocolate , oatmeal , and toasty notes . t/m : huge espresso flavors -- like drinking a starbucks doubleshot . super viscous mouthfeel and low carbonation . silky smooth to boot . more coffee . a burnt characteristic really comes out as the beer warms . did i mention coffee d : a great sipper , but also incredibly drinkable for such a huge mouthfeel and flavor . very tasty

Review:
	received as part of april shipment of my beer of the month club . serving glass : poured from bottle into nonic imperial pint . appearance : slightly hazy reddish amber with very thin head . smell : very mild malt smell , kind of english . where is the hop smell taste : light english malts with nice hop presence that leaves a grapefruit bitter aftertaste that slowly builds . for an ipa , it really is n't all that bitter - more balanced . feel : low carbonation and relatively light body . dry finish . once again , very english . drinkability : pleasant , easy drinking ale . nothing stands out too much , but i like it and could easily enjoy another . this is an english ipa , not an american ipa . it amazes me how many beers have been incorrectly categorized .

Review:
	pale golden very clear brew with lots of carbonation , off white head with large bubbles among smaller ones , decent retention and good lace . very faint in the nose , some grass and hay but very faint . some spiced alcohol but you really got to look for it to notice . taste is similar to smell but the grass presence is much stronger , decent hop/malt balance . almost lacking any kind of aftertaste save for a weak hop flavor . medium fullness of body , leave a thin coat in your mouth . overall an ok beer , probably not something i 'll buy again but it was drinkable .

Review:
	pours fairly dark , clear burgundy color with a nice tan head . aroma is filled with earthy , nutty , malty goodness . taste is similar - roasted notes , malty sweetness and just a touch of hops . this beer is light to medium in body with very low carbonation , low bitterness , and that makes it very drinkable . mouthfeel is pleasant this beer reminds me of scotland and great session beers of that country . at 5 % i personally think it 's too high to be a session beer , but it is still very drinkable and enjoyable . i think it 's very , very good .

Review:
	2010 bottle thanks to mike . thanks mike ! 09 and 10 bottles . pours pitch black with tan head . aroma is coffee , chocolate , and dark fruit . the 09 had more toffee caramel and butterscotch notes . the 10 had more malt roastiness and hops . heavy mouthfeel . flavors followed the nose with both bottles . there were complex layers of roast , chocolate , caramel , and molasses . the toffee caramel flavors were more pronounced in the 1 year aged bottle . that 's why i preferred the aged bottle more . both excellent beers . it reminded me a lot of cigar city marshal zhukov 's imperial stout . great beer .

Review:
	a-clear , light copper hued with a medium off-white head that hung on and left decent lacing behind . s-sweet malt blending well with a fairly pungent peppery hop aroma . t-good solid peppery hop flavour up front . this is balanced well with an ample dose of sweet caramel malt . a well balanced and flavourful apa . m-medium-light body , just a tad thin . hop bitterness lasts through the pint . d-a solid beer , the second best beer of the night here ... .and the best on the regular line up . this one easily out performs the house ipa .

Review:
	a : poured into a tall pilsner glass , it yields a clear , light amber body with a big , airy , off-white head that disappears quickly . s : not sure what that smell is -- first thing that comes to mind is corn syrup and maybe sweet malt ; no , make that over-sweet malt . t : bland and non-offensive at first . like the nose , it 's sweet -- molasses , corn syrup and maybe some caramel malt . a slight metallic aftertaste appears deep at the end of the sip , but mainly this is all about sweetness . m : light in body , slightly slick in feel . d : like i said above , the first few sips were n't so bad . towards the end , however , it became a chore to drink this overly sweet beer and eventually i drained the last few ounces . notes : a bud light-drinking neighbor brought this over , knowing i like <unk> . ' i suppose coors deserves kudos for being able to convince some folks that this fits the bill as a craft-brewed beer . it clearly is not . funny thing is , about 15 years ago , i would sometimes get this in pitchers at certain bars , as it was ( 1 ) darker than your average macro lager ; and ( 2 ) relatively cheap . back then i thought it was n't half bad for what it was . either my tastes have evolved or this brew has gotten significantly worse , because nowadays i am not able to drink this .

Review:
	for the first time i purchased a growler . have tried a number of the big horn beers in the past and they are certainly drinkable . the beer certainly fits the name well and the color of this beer is very red for a standard ipa . had a full white head that had good staying power for having been served in a growler . citrus notes and some acidity are definitely noticeable in the beer . the balance seems off as well since the hops over power the malt to a great extent . not a bad session beer as on a subsequent tasting had a pitcher during a game and noticed all the same things . taste and mouthfeel carry the beer with the hops being the main focus .

Review:
	came to me a pale golden color with a thin white lace . smell was buttery sort of ringwood aroma ( do they use ringwood ? ) and some rotten lemon . not terribly appealing taste had a buttery toffee ringwood flavor ( again , do they use ringwood ? sure seems like it ) , some lemon that just was n't right ( like i said in the smell , like it was rotten , who knows ) , and a soggy wheat sort of flavor . i did not enjoy it at all . mouthfeel was medium bodied , adequately carbonated . i really disliked this brew . this is very rare for me , but i actually could not finish the pint .

Review:

Review:
	pours a clear golden orange color with golden mango colored hues when held to a light source and a thin white foam head that quickly settles into a thin ring . not much in the way of lacing . spicy aroma with hints of cinnamon and brown sugar along with hints of crisp light fruit , pepper , hops and caramel malt . this beer smells more like a marzen to me . softly carbonated up front with a strong spicy character that gives way to a malty center and long spicy dry finish . hints of caramel malt , pepper , light fruit , cinnamon and brown sugar . it kind of tastes like a watered down belgian interpretation of an oktoberfest/marzen .

Review:
	this trappist was not quite as dark as its belgian trappist counterparts . however , do n't judge by that . it is a sweet , extremely smooth , and delicate beer . it gets better as is warms , and is a beer best drank after a meal , when you can just relax with it . the head was not anything to particularly write home about ( i do own a goblet glass for these specialties ) . however , the caramel-coffee smell was very savory , and hard to put down after a drink . it is a strong beer , but the sweetness of it masks the alcohol content nicely . personally , i think it is the best out of the trappist breweries , and is not overly expensive .

Review:
	this one pours a dark mahogany with ruby hints , and a light tan head . very light on the smell , hints of chocolate and roasted malt . creamy cocoa and coffee are at the front of the flavor . roasted grain and a mellow nut flavor back it up , with a hint of hop on the finish . somewhat light , but creamy at the same time , this is a difficult one to try to describe . carbonation is fairly robust . overall this is one of my favorite brews from new belgium . i 'm not a fan of quite a few of their beers , but this one is always a pleasant drinker .

Review:
	pours nearly black , yeilding a murky brown to the light , with a very nice dull tan head . the smell is sour and earthy . the taste is hard to pinpoint , as it is complex , but it is not very bold . malts and clove with a tart aftertaste are present in nearly every sip , while anise , black and roasted malts , even lemon peel and black pepper take turns in the spotlight . the mouthfeel is very smooth , but at the same time slightly watery . drinkability is about medium , not at all effected by abv , but this beer is most certainly filling . overall , most certainly an enjoyable brew , but hard to pair with anything .

Review:
	this is a slightly better alternative to the blue moons out there trying this style . that is not to say this is at the bottom of the list of quality <unk> . poured nicely , with a cloudy/unfiltered body . white head lingered long . smelled of bread and yeast , fruity ... typical whit smells the taste was good , not great . fruity and banana dominated the tastes , but like blue moon this felt slightly watered down and subdued . mouthfeel was crisp and smooth . overall an average beer . not horrible , i 'd drink it again if no better options are available ... but nothing to write home about . typical , if underachieving , whit beer .

Review:
	12oz bottle . pours cola-brown with a whisp on the surface and a few dots of lacing aromatics lead off with roasted malts with hints of chocolate , vanilla and nougat . pretty mild and meak . medium bodied and the mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side for a porter . mildly spritzy . mild roasted malts , dark caramel , and a hint of vanilla start the palate . traces of burnt sugar and char follow through . finishes with light traces of vanilla and roast pretty unimpressive . not offensive but certainly nowhere near as robust or vanilla-like as i would have enjoyed . reminds me of vanilla coke .

Review:
	poured a surprisingly large , 4-finger head . deep , amber color was impressive ( insert sound of screeching tires ... ) smell was typical grolsch euro trash - sour , without anything balancing . please do n't smell this beer if you have one . taste had some light caramel , little bitterness and <unk> . i 'm rating slightly below avg for this style mouthfeel was ok , relatively smooth , and good carbonation throughout actually drinkable , if you plug your nose and do n't expect anything spectacular . one of the 'better ' offerings from gross , um , i mean grolsch .

Review:
	spanking new at beer bistro on-tap . medium mouthfeel , neutral yellow-gold . not much head , creamy . malty more than bitter . sweetish aftertaste . like other durhams , light and fresh , this one very fresh , but also with edges rounded out for acceptability . good transition ale .

Review:
	hazy bright orange in color with a fluffy white head that quickly dissapates , leaving delicate lace . way too orange looking . aroma is very mild wheat and subtle spice completely dominated by artificial orange . smells like tang . flavor ditto . tastes like an artificially flavored witte . there 's no way the orange flavor is authentic . mouthfeel is actually nice and creamy with that good wheaty quality . too bad it tastes like an orange soda .

Review:
	thanks to murph for the sample ... . poured a bright , clear copper color , with a thin , tight head , and just a hint of lacing in the glass . nose was subdued , malty , with some peaty notes . good mouthfeel for the bruce . taste exhibited some malt , but too weak . some smoky/peaty action in there , as well as a touch of hops at the end lending some bitterness . i was looking for more malt and sweetness ... .not to be found here . overall : 3.55 appearance : 3.5 | smell : 3.5 | taste : 3.5 | mouthfeel : 4 | drinkability : 3.5

Review:
	poured out dark , cloudy and brown with a creamy off-white head . the nose is sugar , molasses , bread , and a bit of alcohol . the taste is similar to the smell but with a slightly smokey aspect . this aspect is a bit much , but the molasses and alcohol and a big bite that balances . the mouthfeel is creamy with a bit of carbonated bite . the finish is ever so slightly on the huge side .

Review:
	uber rarity , unfortunately the bottle i received was corked . from notes . appearance : pour is a red-orange amber , small white head . smell : off musty / rotten flavors that you expect from corked wine ; i have sampled in the neighborhood of 30-50 bottles of cantillon in my life and this is the first one that has been 'bad ' , i knew almost instantly that something was amiss taste : the must / rotten flavors dominate on the first sip . very much a tca issue , there was no way to finish it or enjoy the bottle . this is not 'good ' funk , as i typically enjoy those sorts of flavors , from cantillon in particular . sourness was still there . it is one of those things some people do n't pick up on , but once you know the taint you will always detect it . mouthfeel : dry , thin , medium carbonation . drinkability : as described above , this bottle clearly had some issues . i doubt i get to try it again and do not know where those issues came from , but as-is it was undrinkable . i noticed some people may have picked up on this from reading other reviews , to a lesser extent , while some may not have had an issue at all .

Review:
	a : pours a burnt orangish red color . not quite copper , but close . a decent foam head that eventually disappears . blotchy lacing that lasts the whole drink . s : lots of hops and barley . lots of citrus with just a small sprinkling of malt . t : lots of citrus hop flavoring , with some caramel , toffee and bread . the hop flavoring definitely is the more predominant . m : a slick oily mouthfeel . d : a good ale with a high abv . not a good session beer . would be worth cellaring .

Review:
	picked up at gordon 's in watertown bottle <unk> bottled 1/20/10 poured in to my portsmouth tulip a : this beer pours a cloudy , ruddy , dark brown with some reddish highlights to it . a huge finger of creamy khaki color head caps this beer off . head recedes at a moderate pace leaving chunks of sticky lacing on the glass s : nose is rather musty and musky , some yeast and wheats filter in , a sweet character comes through and a bit of earthiness . t : taste is yeast , wheat , massive funk that basically fills out the middle . so musty and musky , but mingled with a crazy almost caramel malt sweetness . hints of ... a earthy , hay like quality in the finish . m : medium to full body , moderate carbonation , light yet creamy body . d : goes down alright , milder kick than the abv would indicate , a decent beer but i would go with others of the style .

Review:
	a : the pour is an amber sort of color with a nice finger 's worth of off-white head . s : a very pleasant citrus hop aroma of grapefruits and oranges along with a very nice pine note . a bit of sweet caramel malt underneath . t : there is a bit more malt sweetness than i generally prefer for an ipa , but the piney hops provide a really excellent bitterness to the beer . the citrus notes are more subtle , but quite pleasant . m : medium both in terms of body and carbonation with a nice bitter finish . d : this was really nice and i always enjoy trying a beer from a ( new to me ) brewery . i would definitely give this one another go .

Review:
	12 oz a- orange tinged light amber , a nice head that does n't quite fully dissipate , and leaves beautiful lacing down my mug . <unk> hops . that 's about it , the low spot of the beer . t- love the flavor complexity of racer five . initial pine/grapefruit hops , much like the nose , but then it smooths out to a biscuit malt flavor with that wonderful apricot sweetness . ends with a bitterness/dryness that 's just enough to make you want the next sip m- feels thicker than it looks with just enough carbonation . almost creamy initially in the mouth . d- really , really nice change up from most ipa 's . highly drinkable . i really enjoy this as a change up to the normal dogfish head 60 min , smuttynose , and victory hop devil that are readily available in my area .

Review:
	served in a hoegaarden glass at just over fridge temperature appearance- pours a cloudy pale gold , the head cresting at about two fingers and settling to a fine mat . looks like a good witbier , solid in appearance . smell- bold , no-holds-barred display of coriander spice and orange peel ... fresh and spritzy , allagash does n't disappoint here . really nice . taste- solid wheat notes , maybe more textural but definitely there ... backed by the smooth coriander and beautifully floral hop character . the beer has terrific balance and runs its course so eloquently for this style . mouthfeel/drinkability- light and prickly in the beginning , it swells in such a smooth , easy way ... emphasizing the spices and wheat character . light but very distinctive and totally appropriate . what a great witbier , the best u.s . take on the style .

Review:
	pours a deep brown color . it 's got the characteristic brown ale flavor with some caramel and a big dry hop punch . i like brown ales , and i like hops , but the flavors seemed unintegrated to me . i would have preferred they blend more . not my favorite dogfish head brew , though it was refreshing served cold on a hot day .

Review:
	a cloudy amber mahogany beer with a light khaki head . some fantastic retention but no real lacing . smell has some floral fruitiness and a light pine scent but not super hoppy . its more of a malt sweetness with some nice carmel toasted toffee scents . there is a grainy solvent like smell that tips you off to the higher abv . a medium body with a sweet malty flavor . fine smooth ( champagne like ) carbonation that is n't over the top but a nice compliment to the tastes . there is a slight bitterness and a warm toasted toffee flavor that is n't too intense . a smooth and creamy feel in the mouth with a fine dry aftertaste . makes me want to drink some more . very pleasing and easy to drink . the bottle has a best by date of <unk> . impressive how the brewery knows the exact date their beverage expires . very worth a try .

Review:
	clear medium copper/amber with a substantial tan head that retains fairly well but does n't manage much lacing the aroma is toasted grain , a hint of caramel and just a faint trace of grass and citrus the taste also starts off with a toasted malt note but is followed quickly by a kick of very grassy hops , which intensifies toward the finish with a burst of citrus peel ( grapefruit ? ) and a carbonic aftertaste light bodied , highly carbonated but easy enough to drink . the best i 've had yet from weston , but still needs a bit of work .

Review:
	on tap at the beer company . a : yellow gold with a large white head , decent retention , and no lacing . s : redolent of pear , apple , and banana . wheat and grain provide the malt foundation , and there 's a light phenolic note that reminds me of clove . sweetness is at an upper light level . t : apple and wheat with banana and light clove . the beer has a lower moderate sweetness with a lot of yeast-driven fruit notes . the finish is dry , smooth , and lightly spicy with no evident alcohol . m : lower medium body with moderate carbonation . the mouthfeel is smooth and sticky . overall : a solid belgian pale ale .

Review:
	poured a cloudy red-orange color with a quickly dissipating head leaving little lacing . aroma was a little bread like with a different mix of hops that i did n't care for , just did n't seem right . same with the taste , tasted a bit like old grass . medium bodied with a little above average carbonation , seemed alright in this aspect . i just did n't really care for this , i did n't even finish the entire 12oz bottle , so i ca n't give it a high number on drinkability . i was hoping to like this more , i enjoyed their oatmeal stout , but i will pass on this one .

Review:
	22oz bomber - thanks to <unk> for this appearance - slightly hazy dark amber/copper colour with a small size fizzy white coloured head . there is a low amount of carbonation showing and there is some faint lacing . the head lasted for only a minute minutes . smell - malts , caramel , hops , grapefruit taste & mouth - there is a low amount of carbonation and i can taste malts , caramel and some hops . there is also a bit of tangerine and grapefruit . it ends with a malty sweet aftertaste with a medium amount of lingering hop bitterness . overall - there has to be something wrong with my bottle.. it 's almost like it 's from a cask . there was no head , and the beer is basically flat . i can tell that the beer has some promise , but this is not what i was expecting . i see no code/date on the bottle . oh well , i 'll try to re-review , but i 'll probably just end up buying sculpin instead .

Review:
	short tan head with poor retention smell is similar to darkness with the sweeter fruit aromas coming through . there is a lot more roast which is a nice change of pace . there is also a bit of smokiness that comes from british roasted malts . more bitterness as a result of the roasted malts , again a very slightly smoked flavor comes through which adds a nice layer to the taste . medium bodied beer with perfect carbonation overall , i went in to this one expecting not to like it but it ended up being one of my favorites . much dryer than most of the highly rated imperial stouts on this site , which i like , and that added smoke really brings this to another level .

Review:
	pours a very hazy yellow with a hint of orange . smells very citrusy/hoppy and scared me originally when i sniffed it . had all the makings of a pale ale nightmare . how happily wrong i was . has a very active bubbly white head that just looks great receding down the tulip glass . damn good looking beer . the taste is interesting . syrupy sweet with a hint of malt and a lot of <unk> up front . quite a good sized body for a mild beer . finishes sweet as it began with some nice carbonation tingling on the tounge . another gem from ommegang .

Review:
	this beer pours a full bodied dull golden in color with a two finger bright white head . this has got to be the thickest wheat beer i 've ever seen . imagine a gold imperial stout in appearance . the aromas are earthy , grassy , lemon , and feature a tart yeasty aspect which is quite interesting . the flavors took me by surprise . it 's moderately tart and you can pick up the different yeasts . it 's very grassy and again features a lemon like tartness . it drinks kind of dry and is full in body . the viscosity makes this wheat a little harder to get through than most . drinking a glass makes you feel like you just consumed a loaf of bread . it 's definitely an interesting beer and i 'm glad it had so much complexity for the style . i 'd recommend trying this one , but probably sharing it with a friend .

Review:
	this is the common generally available 'bitter ' beer on hand pull in many pubs in my home town area in uk . unfortunately since coors took over the bass brewery some years ago , the beer has changed its character somewhat to how it tasted 10 years ago . it can also be very variable in quality , and i am not sure if this is due to the way it is kept by the pub staff , or the fault of the brewery . when in good condition ( and the best way to have it is straight from the barrel by gravity feed and no head , though thats rare to see ! ) it is a medium dark colour ( for a 'pale ' ale ) rich and inviting , with a more maltly aroma , but also a bit sulphury from the <unk> water ' that characterises this style and origin of the beer . the taste is smooth and malty , the hoppy bitterness well in the background , also hints of spicyness . over the last few years it seems to be less flavourful , the general malty smooth taste can remain , but less depth of flavour and character , and sometimes a bit sour and appears to be 'off ' in recent tastings of the beer , on more than one occasion we have had to take the beer back because it was obviously going off . this is a great shame , as it was a great traditional british beer with lots of character and easy to drink . i have rated it disregarding the 'off ' samples had recently b'ham uk

Review:
	this winter ale has a dark brown appearance and foamy head . the aroma is a pleseant toasted nut . the taste has a big nut flavor upfront that becomes slightly hoppy . the flavor moves into a spice on the back end . the body is medium for a winter brew . the thirst for another is not too great . overall i like to have one of these every season for a nice switch .

Review:
	a nicer color than a lot of light lagers i 've seen . a bit darker than normal perhaps . no head to speak of . no scent to speak of . very little taste to speak of . slightly malty , but in general fairly bland . considering the name they gave this one , i expecting a beer with a bit more power . i guess the hops give it a tiny bit of spice , but it 's not so much a lightning bolt as licking a 9-volt battery . this one just fails to impress all around . order one of hops ' darker brews .

	had this on tap at the first street draught house in town . i 've had this in bottle form , but this is a first on tap . came out a dark brown with ruby edges and a good 1-inch tan head on top . retention was fair , but there was tons of sticky lacing on the glass edge . smells like molasses , brown sugar , toasted bread , and roasted nuts the mouth was creamy and smooth with a touch of carbonation on the tongue . the brown sugar that i found in the scent is also in the flavor . this is a pleasantly sweet , roasty brown ale . bitterness is low . plenty of malty goodness in this beer . i much preferred this beer on tap

Review:
	strong golden colour , with oranged reflexes , a lot of creamy and white foam . the smell is very fresh , herbaceous and floreal ( roses ? ) , with cream , cereals ( oats ) . fizzy ( maybe a little too much ) , with a round taste , but 'simple ' , without the complexity of the smell . maybe lightly <unk> . the body is medium and round , with a good hop . we found a clear difference between two glasses , one with the bottom ( yeast ) of the bottle , and the other without it . in the first it was noticeable even some solvent ...

	on tap at the trappist in oakland , ca . nice dark amber appearance , great head retention . cool sour wet horse blanket notes on the aroma that are mostly in aroma , not so much in the actual taste . pretty low carbonation for the style . much sweeter in the finish than you would expect from the aroma . nice complexity when you want a balance of sweet/sour . great complexity of flavors considering the alcohol content . very drinkable and enjoyable .

Review:
	it 's winter time , my favorite time of year for seasonal beers , and this has caught my eye for a little while so i picked up a sixer . pours nicely without much head , but it 's a nice dark copper color . smell punches you in the face with nutmeg and cinnamon ; not quite what i 'm looking for , to be frank . the taste of nutmeg and cinnamon are way too up-front as far as i 'm concerned . totally overwhelms any depth that might be had with this beer in a totally superficial sort of way . i understand that it 's supposed to be a beer brewed with spices , but they really ought to be integrated with the beer , not the only thing it tastes like . it tastes a lot like pumpkinhead ale in this respect , actually , in that it 's way too overwhelming and poor . mouthfeel is average . easy to down , i guess , but the poor integration of the spices makes it difficult to stomach without holding your nose . find a better winter warmer . there are lots .

Review:
	thanks to americanbrew for sharing this bottle . the beer pours a yellow-amber color with a white head . the aroma is alcohol , wheat , citrus and surprisingly , some darker fruit the flavor is grain , toffee and alcohol . after the aroma i was expecting a little more from the aroma , but it is still not bad medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation definitely better than the basic malt liquors that come in clear , 40 ounce bottles .

Review:
	i had this on-tap at eulogy . large , creamy head . this beer has a nice , estery character , but it could be so much more . bottle-conditioned would be the preferred way to go with this one . very good on-tap . i would assume it would have much more complexity in the bottle . in my mind 's eye , i picture that tasting wonderfully . a lot of belgian beers are that way . remember , on-tap is not always better .

Review:
	pours bright orange with small white foam that quickly disappears . smells heavy of grapefruit and citrus , little maltiness . tastes as though grapefruit has been added . low carbonation . not getting much malt body through the bitterness of the hop . there is something in there though rounding off the corners . i was expecting a bold dipa/iipa but it seems this beer has taken a little different course than <unk> . however , its mellowness is kind of appreciated . very nice , if muted , taste . the beer is lazy in the glass but does react on the tongue when sipping . mouthfeel is pretty good for a sipper of this type . drinkability is good assuming the known limit is 1-2 . is this the future of dipas ? i guess the oracle would know .

Review:
	bottle into a standard pint glass . dark amber to bronze pour , smallish off-white head that moves to a coating . lacing is present but spotty . there is citrus , caramel , pine , and malt in the nose taste is citrus , floral , caramel , pine but a lot of caramel . this is mildly bitter in the finish . medium to heavier body with decent carbonation . decent ipa but heavy on the sweeter side ( not a plus for me ) and not much taste remains until the next sip . i would try this again but it is not on the top of my list .

Review:
	a - two fingers of sudsy white head , the body is hazy golden-brown . s - strong fruity/ spicy aroma of plums , raisins , almonds , bananas , cloves , black pepper , anise , and a moderate level of wet , mossy , earthy funk . spectacularly complex aroma . t - bready banana flavor up front along with cloves , and nutmeg . some raisins and caramel appear in the middle and are replaced by molasses and chocolate in the finish along with a lingering tobacco note . m - medium-thick body , with very high carbonation , and a dry finish . d - wow , an amazingly complex beer . there is a bit of a disconnect between the dark flavors in this beer and its relatively light color . the carbonation borders on being a bit too high and the alcohol is kind of hot , but these minor flaws are overshadowed by the complexity , especially of the aroma . overall i am quite impressed with this beer and i ca n't wait to try some more of de dolle 's other offerings .

Review:
	*i am rating this for what it is ... a specialty chocolate lager ... i realize this may not be for everyone but for the style it is quite nice.. dark brown color ... .creamy texture in the mouth ... .medium bodied ... .huge sweet melted milk chocolate aroma ... .also some powdered hot cocoa mix.. taste is sweet and big on the milk chocolate ... .at first it seems almost a little too sweet but it finishes very clean ... drinks like a lager ... might be a bit much for some people but i think they did a nice job with this . i am amazed there is no 'real ' chocolate added . it tastes and smells like there <unk> some wheat malt in this ... to me this is a souped up schwartzbeir on chocolate steroids ... i think this is a nice effort by miller and one that can serve as an after dinner beer for many ... even non-beer drinkers ...

Review:
	this is mac 's interpretation of an india pale ale . i 'm more inclined to call it a <unk> pale ale , rather than an ipa , but who am i to argue with the brewer . let me explain . this beer , according to <unk> 's , is a 'late hopped pale ale . ' in practical terms -- at least to my <unk> -- that results in a very raw hoppiness . they use a combination of five different hops -- all grown in nelson , nz -- and they 're not added until the end of the boil , which leaves a hoppy freshness right at the front of this beer . it 's almost as if the hops are not in this beer but on it . pours a dark gold color with a slight amber hue . good , sticky head retention . overall , this is a very unique brew . how unique ? consider this : in 4.5 months of traveling in europe ( including belgium & germany ) then new zealand , this is the only one i felt compelled to take notes on ! if you 're ever down new zealand , skip the lion red and export gold crap that floods the shelves and look for this beer . mac 's beers are made from 'all natural ingredients ' ( a phrase that actually has some meaning in new zealand ) .

Review:
	1 year old bottle- dark chestnut with slight head but excellent retention . slight lacing . the aroma has a bit of 'off ' scented hops . not bad , but not the a pleasant hop variety in terms of aroma . a lot of malt comes through but it 's well balanced . the taste actually reminds me a little of old ruffian . less aggresive on the hops though with a sweeter malt bill . there 's a bit of spiciness and a good dose of peat the body is medium full and medium heavy . carbonation is nice and light . the finish is dry and slightly sticky . overall , this was n't what i expected for a year old english style old ale but i was impressed nonetheless .

Review:
	11.2oz bottle , sam adams glass , no freshness date a shade darker and deeper than a hearty ipa , the head is n't large but consistent . there was yeast in the bottle , as there should be , and i poured some but not all other than classic belgian yeast must , a nasally refreshing wintergreen lends almost physical coolness that can also be perceived as clean lemon . it could also even be clean pine , but not in a hoppy way lemon grass , ginger , smaller wintergreen . banana and clove via the yeast . this is a nice , complex , controlled beer of this style . moderate belgian biscuity malt , a little like its been sitting out in humidity . more cool lemon peel there is nothing special other than the flavors in the mouth and it 's thin i ca n't taste the alcohol , and because it adds nothing past intoxication potential i ca n't see why this beer needs to be 8.5 % abv .

Review:
	i actually acquired this from another beer enthusiast of which whom i work with . he bought it from a grocery store that just opened up here in hampton roads and is known for their exotic foods at very low prices . i am known to drink a lot of wheat beers and he brought me a few to see what i thought . although it is a very light wheat beer , the flavor was spot-on for a hefeweizen . i was impressed with the aroma , and the affordability and taste made it a must have for my next dinner party .

Review:
	it 's an old classic in the 'light ' version . the <unk> champagne of beers . now not so premium , but in the bottom of the cooler at albeit a bargain price . mildly sweet corny smell and a consistant lager taste . slight bitterness but consistent throughout from start to finish . good carbonation . not a unique beer for the demanding <unk> 's taste , but ice cold is a great way to refresh a hot summer day . brings back lots of memories of tall blondes . a summer sessioner without a doubt . i can drink this all day or all night long ( or both ) . i see they 've even bumped up the ac a tad .

Review:
	the bottle i have is called paradox longrow , and has japanese writing on half the label . since the springbank distillery produces the longrow expressions , this may be the same thing as the paradox springbank batch 17 , but in the interest of simplifying things , let 's make a longrow entry , since springbank does make other whiskys . this beer pours an opaque black , with reddish-copper edges , and two fingers of soapy beige head , that leaves consistent webbed lacing as it recedes . it smells of bitter roasted coffee , and a little salty , peaty seaside essence . the taste is mildly bitter coffee , chocolate , butterscotch , vanilla , and a slight resinous herbal character . the alcohol is very well integrated , appearing only as a slight overall warming . the carbonation is quite low , the body fairly full , creamy , and a bit slick , and it finishes with a little more of those understated island seaside whiskey notes - salt , iodine , peat . this is more tame , yet also more balanced , than the previous whiskey barrel riss that i 've had from brewdog . it 's quite enjoyable , a lovely sipper .

	pours a dark brown that shows ruby highlights when held into the light . thin off-white head that has decent retention and shows minimal lacing . extremely clear . the nose is very sweet and very malty . roasted malts take over the nose at first , but chocolate and coffee notes battle it out . not overly complex nose , but a solid one nonetheless . taste is exactly what you would expect from the nose , no surprises here . roasted malts dominate , coffee and chocolate come into play , but do n't compete with the roasted malts dominance . there is a slight spicey character that was not noticed in the nose , but now that i taste it i can definitely see it being in the nose as well . 7.3 % abv is nowhere to be found . medium body , very smooth and rich . light carbonation . i find this very drinkable , and the 7.3 % abv is not noticeable at all . if this were available in my area , i would be getting this all the time .

Review:
	pours a clear golden/yellow with a medium head that leaves decent lacing . this really looks like any other large macro beer . the smell is sweet malt , floral , and 'bisquity ' . the taste is crisp with a lemon flavor along with sweet malt , floral , bread yeast , and honey . the m/f is light with flavors mixing well . not a bad beer , but it 's really not that great .

Review:
	appearance : appropriately orange with a full creamy head and lacing . smell : more subdued than dfh punkin or weyerbacher imperial in the nutmeg , cardamom space . a distinctive toffee in the nose . taste : this one comes together well . lighter than the aforementioned and more 'sessionable ' . more like pumpkin pie . drinkability : had this at a local restaurant where i usually switch up , but stayed with this

Review:
	pours a clear reddish amber with a couple scant bubbles rising hither and yon topped off with a thin khaki collar bright citrus orange and tangerine hops with a good balance of malts and the hops first swigs : well balanced easy smooth hops and malt . a solid mix that says am ipa all the way . some smooth orange citus and almost rye malt . fast <unk> finish . a touch of peach too . some tackiness . medium bodied feel with a soft carbonation . since there a million beers out there just like this , it 's hard to go ga-ga on drinkability . last swigs : orange lolipop ! thanks to aksmoked porter for the bottle .

Review:
	poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter : appearance and smell : poured a very dark brown , just about black and did n't allow much light through . had a very minimal cream colored head which dissipated quickly and just sat at the edge of the glass . smelled of roasty almost burned coffee , along with some sweet mocha chocolate notes . nice strong smelling brew . taste and mouthfeel : tasted of coffee , burned sugar and a hint of bitter sweet chocolate which resides with the sweet caramel malt presence . was pretty light to medium bodied with a noticeable carbonation presence . left a dry , earthy hop bitterness in the finish . drinkability : very drinkable , pretty light feel overall . finished with a bit more bitterness than expected . i 'd definitely drink more of this for sure , just probably would n't seek it out .

Review:
	a bright , golden filtrated beer with a thick head . smell is like a tripel , with solvent and fruity smells , but it also has a distinct dirty socks smell that is very disturbing . taste is light malty with a nice yeast profile of exotic fruits and a little solvent and higher <unk> . again this strange taste comes up and develops from dirty socks into overcooked vegetables . especially when swallowed this taste is at the end of my tongue . one of the few drained beers i had .

Review:
	22oz bottle acquired via trade with hopderek aroma : strong hop aroma coming out of the pour , citrus hops as is typical among american ipas . a nice smelling ipa , it previews what its going to bring appearance : beautiful amber color with an inch or so of moderately fluffy white head , which produces fine lacing . a standard look for the style . taste : slick malt taste is the main component , but the hops still bite -- bitter hops are there to keep the taste in check , and to leave you wanting more feel : this one was super balanced , as the malt really made this one smooth on the tongue . a nice medium body on the beer with a nice dose of carbonation too . drinkability : i had to look up the abv , as the alcohol did not come out very strong . 8.4 % is hidden quite well , and without the harsh , mouthful of hops taste that other ipas have , this one is quite pleasant to drink all told , odyssey is a pretty good double ipa , pretty easy to drink too , but there are still several others i would rather have . definitely worth a try though

Review:
	served from bottle into a stone nonic . poured a deep dark brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly . maintained decent lacing throughout the glass . the aroma was comprised of sweet malt , maple syrup , and caramel . the flavor was of sweet malt , maple syrup , caramel , wood , and subtle tart . it had a medium feel with medium-high carbonation . overall this was a decent brew . i really was n't that impressed with this one if i am honest . glad that the alcohol presence was n't here though as it would have made it unbearable for me with these flavors . nothing too memorable here at all . worth trying if you get the chance but that is about it .

Review:
	aromas of lightly roasted malts , some lighter toffee and a light earthy hoppiness the taste begins with a lot of the same ; toasted and bready malty grains , caramels , toffee sweetness . as it warms there is some light earthy , almost metallic bitterness , which is rather unpleasant to be honest . the finish is pleasantly dry with some detection of mineral water flavors which adds a nice dryness . overall this is nothing to write home about or seek out because of the generic flavors , especially because of the unnecessarily high abv which inhibits further consumption . if i 'm consuming something over 6 abv it needs flavor , which this is lacking .

Review:
	on tap at pope in philly pours a completely clouded golden color with some yellow hues . thick , frothy white head retains well on top , fading into some layers of film with some rings of lacing on the glass spicy and citrusy on the nose . some lemon peel and cracked pepper with a hint of orange sweetness . barely any alcohol with some soft brett funk and yeast splash of floral hops up front with peppery spice . some herbal notes followed by citrus juiciness and lemon peel . a little sweet in the middle from the fruit . hints of bretty funk and belgian yeast , but not quite tart . finishes a little spicy medium body , higher carbonation , refreshing and tingly on the palate . a solid saison , although i was hoping for more brett presence .

Review:
	got a small bottle for $ 7 at tap and table in emmaus , pa . poured into a large snifter , the beer is a bit of a foamer and really needs to warm up before it comes to life . even then the hops are n't that big , though flowery hops dominate the taste . there 's a light bready flavor in the background and behind the more citrusy hops in the aroma . of course , as a good belgian , the boy is drinkable , relatively light for its strength , and complimented by typical , sweet belgian spice .

Review:
	bison organic ipa the appearance of this beer is a cloudy amber hue . an unfiltered orgainic beer is sort of <unk> ' sounding . i 've had one organic ipa beer before and it totally ruined my view of the word 'organic ' when refering to beer . the nose on this beer is very nice . fresh hops and a slight malt sweetness . at first taste , i really like the beer . it has a bread-like flavor to it but still stays hoppy . the mouthfeel of the beer is crisp and direct . it definitely registers as a west coast ipa . i 'm not sure what type of hops are used but its not the typical cascade , simcoe , centennial combo . maybe its the 'organic ' hops ? as for drinkability , i could handle a couple of these but use it more as a stepping stone to a higher hopped ipa during a session . nice solid ipa ; changed my view of 'organic '

Review:
	the brew pours a dark brown/black colour . the head is tall and brown . the nose almost reminds me of long trail 's porter ( brewery only ) in that the hops dominate the malts outright . when drinking though the hops and the malts harmonize and balance each other nicely , well done ( original date of review- 2/11/08 )

Review:
	pours black with ruby highlights and an off-white head . nose shows bold milk chocolate by the truckload along with cocoa and some soft roasted malt . some spicy hops are evident in the background - just . that chocolate is awesome flavours include more of a roasty character but still show a lot of dark chocolate . these two flavours linger on well past the soft bitterness . carbonation is the main flaw , it 's too high to accompany these rich flavours . otherwise very impressive .

Review:
	i had this on tap at eulogy . poured a dark amber color with a tannish , long lasting head with good lacing throughout the drink . the aroma was one of malty sweetness and some fruitiness as well . the taste is a complex one with a carbonated malty sweetness with hints of raisins and currants . there is a nice bitter finish that is not strong enough to overshadow the sweetness but balances the taste nicely . it is smooth and creamy in the mouth and i was ready for a second one .

Review:
	appearance : poured a cloudy dark amber color . the effect of the swirling yeast is really cool ! head was about an inch and a half of off-white foam , but quickly went away to nothing . smell : pungent bouquet of fruit , mostly pear , and a wisp of alcohol . very enticing . taste : sweet fruity esters and a touch of fusel alcohol . typical belgian flavors , but more robust than , say , leffe . mouthfeel : slightly creamy from the carbonation , with a warming alcohol effect . overall a very smooth beer . drinkability : very tasty and very respectable belgian for a special occasion , but the high abv limits the drinkability of this brew . personally , i think belgians taste so much different from your average beer that i would n't want to drink more than one at a time .

Review:
	poured into room temp pint glass . i let sit for 10 minutes before drinking . appearance - a very light brownish color with a hint of orange . light head , which settled into a thin layer , decent lacing . smell - definitely an ipa , by the good amount of floral aroma that hits your nose . also has a piney scent . this is a very pleasant smelling beer . taste - to steal a line from old school 'once it hits your lips , it 's so good ' . seriously though , very strong hop taste , but not entirely bitter . earthy and citrus notes as well . yeasty , as prevalent by the yeast you can see in your glass . mouthfeel - very smooth , low carbonation . drinkability - i could drink a few of these , definitely one of the better ipa 's that i have tasted .

Review:
	a very hazy gold , with streaks of orange and light red running silently through it . very light yet wholesome citrus , primarily lemon which overshadows very subtle and smooth orange peel . very slight vanilla . fairly light and smooth while being a little over carbonated for my liking . slight lemon and very insignificant hints of zestier orange . this is a perfect summer time beer , not much too it , not much to think about , and pretty refreshing . maybe a little too plain for my liking though .

Review:
	st patricks day 'once a year brew ' according to the bottle . pours a copper/amber color with a creamy , tightly packed off white head . ok lace . not as much of a reddish color as i would have thought . aromas of sweet malt , caramel some fruitiness and a nice hop presence . nice grainy sweet malt upfront followed by the caramel and fruit . great balance with an earthy , slightly spicy hop bitterness . seemed a bit thin bodied but had a rich , mildly creamy mouthfeel and a good amount of carbonation . alcohol was hidden really well and this was extremely drinkable . anyone for a session irish red

Review:
	well , being a stout lover i was intrigued by this offering . cherries seem like a natural pairing with a stout . after finishing it , i was more then a little bit disappointed . a : poured as black as the remnants of an ink well ( in my brand new tenth year anniversary ommegang glass by the way ) . no head whatsoever and i was a bit aggressive with my pour . s : curiously devoid of any real odors . as the beer warmed up , i did detect the faint hint of cherries . t : not that i regularly partake in cold medicine , but this stuff reminded me of nyquil and it only got worse as time passed ( yes , it took a while to finish it off ) . medicinal taste with a sour/bitter finish . m : oily and viscous , it seemed to leave a thin coating on the palate for several minutes after each sip . linked to the less then appealing taste and it was not a pleasant reminder . d : as stated above , this one took awhile to finish off . very disapponted , as bell 's other offerings are pretty good . i would not recommend this stout to anyone ( unless i was angry with them and wanted to see them suffer ) .

Review:
	pours a dingy coper in color with an interesting head , and some good lacing . the smell is strong with apples and beligan yeast and spices . the taste is reminiscent of the smell with tart apples and an almost wine like quality . the prominent yeast flavor is complex and overall the alcohol is hidden rather well . mouthfeel is not overpowering but in no way watery . overall a grate offering from unibroue .

Review:
	22 oz bottle into a couple of tulip glasses pours black ( ruby comes out along the edges ) with a finger of foamy light-mocha head . this maintains some richness to the look , leaving back frothy sticky lace that clings to the sides of the glass . the aroma smells floral and citric , with a good bit of chocolate mixed in . roast pushes up from underneath giving this a light crunchiness in the nostrils the taste has an assertive green citric bite , balanced across the back by sweet notes of chocolate and caramel malts . dark roasted coffee character is mostly confined to the finish , where it hangs with some leftover bitter fruit . the mouthfeel is medium bodied and over sharp feeling in the mouth , the whole way through . that 7 % feels about right on target here , giving the body some oomph but still keeping any alcohol warmth at a distance this was a decent take on the style from blue point with a well balanced and fairly easy drinking mix of flavors . i just wish that the overall profiles put a bit more out there for you to wrap your palate around . this seemed a bit muted . <unk> not sure if this was because of the age of the bottle or not . <unk> be willing to reinvestigate this one .

Review:
	a : near black body with creamy tan head . s : raisins , smoke and coffee primarily . t : the milk shows up strong , adding a sweeter dimension to the already oatmeal raisin chocolate cookie-like flavors . some slight herbal hop along the way . smoke also lingers on the finish . m : creamy with a long finish . d : great balance of sweet and smokey with a smooth body . it 's an easy drinker , full of flavor without being too big at all . the sweet comes from both the fruit and the milk , balancing the acidity on that end as well . really pleasant .

Review:
	a : the pour reveals a burgundy-tinged hue that lets some light in , topped by a one-finger head that stays around briefly , but dissipates to a thin layer of bubbles on top . s : malty aroma is large with the smell of toasted malt , toffee , figs , and sharp/sweet alcohol . the bouquet is fairly formidable , with all of these scents coming together nicely , reminiscent of an old ale in smell . t : surprisingly , the malt flavor plays second-fiddle to the sweetness of this beer . while the introduction gives off a decent maltiness , the assault comes in the middle with a sweet , mildly hopped bitter and alcohol taste that pushes toward the finish . aftertaste is of the initial malt and the sugar-like sweetness . m : light-bodied and carbonated adequately for the style they 're attempting . slightly syrupy , as in almost like the cloying sweetness of cough syrup . d : wee heavys are tricky beasts , and this one is no different . honestly , i was n't overly impressed with this one , but still thought it was a valiant effort . the drinkability is not as high with the attack of sweet flavor and the aftertaste it leaves .

Review:
	had this on-tap at my local haunt pours a dark reddish-brown color with a short fizzy head . faint toasted malt smell , but couldnt really notice anything else in the aroma . malty , slightly sweet taste with a crisp , dry mouthfeel . couldnt detect much in the hops department . basically this beer was n't bad , but it was n't great either . could use a bit more character . but on the plus side ... it was pretty smooth and drinkable and went well with my steak .

Review:
	pours a murky gold with white head that hangs around for awhile . the smell is the best part of this beer . a citrus sourness with light caramel tones . the taste is very yeast forward as to be expected . a lemony kinda of quality on the front but the malt quickly comes in and calms the notes from the yeast . i must say though i wish there was a little more flavor from the malt to balance a bit more . not a bad not a great beer . my 3rd beer from this brewery and my least favorite .

Review:
	pours out like motor oil . deep black , with brown edges and a small mocha colored head which fades quickly but leaves lacing . some small chunkies hang near the bottom . nose is thick vanilla bourbon , with heavy malts and oak alcohol . first sip is burnt charred oak chips , with molasses and dense caramel . more alcohol on warming , and some brown sugar sweetness . very nice . mouthfeel is dense and thick , fitting the taste of the beer . drinkability may be hurt by the abv , but it 's a damn fine beer .

Review:
	a : a hazy yellow with at frothy two finger head . looks just as it should . s : some lemon zest and perhaps some other spices and fruits . very fresh . t : off the charts ! i get some bready flavors along with a little tartness from what i believe to be lemons . a nice , clean , hoppy taste at the end . m : a little carbonation , slighty creamy , but finishes crisp and smooth . d : very tasty , very easy to drink . i imagine you could throw down quite a few of these in place of your everyday lager .

Review:
	a : what little head appeared was gone in less than a minute , leaving only the golden-amber liquid to speak for itself s : subdued hop aroma , some malty and grainy notes in the nose that remind me of a subtle english pale t : pale malt flavors come first , with the hops right on its heels , making for a marginally bitter middle and finish . lots of grain throughout , with the hops taking on a kind of grassy character . this is especially noticed at the very end m : some hop oil texture , dry and bitter feel in the aftertaste that coats the palate all over d : enough flavor to be commendable , but as far as a great pale ale goes , this one does n't quite cut it . frankly , i think some of the styles many see as <unk> ' can be the hardest to perfect , and i 'm by no means deriding the brewery . i just feel that this one may need more work .

Review:
	pours a dense , opaque black body with a creamy , khaki colored head that is very slow to dissolve to a thin lacing . robust aromas of roasted malt and chocolate float from the glass with dark fruits appearing as it warms . chocolate aromas permeate at the close the flavor is quite good featuring a nice blend of roasted malt , milky chocolate and hints of dark fruit such as cherry or plum . as it warms the roasted aspects become more dominant medium carbonation with a full body and roasted finish . nice imperial stout , on the roasted side but lacking some of the hop traits i would expect in the american double stout version .

Review:
	lightly greenish yellow clear appearance with some upwelling bubbles . no real head generation , but a couple of <unk> line rings mark the sips . astringent cidery aroma , some sense of <unk> pops . pretty much what you smell is what you get , plenty of white grape , maybe a touch of a crab apple jelly sweetness and an overall wine-like impression . slightly dryish finish , not a lot of <unk> as i was expecting . not my style to be sure , though some of the thicker mead-like beers like dogfish head midas touch are sometimes more up my alley .

Review:
	consumed feb . 7th , 2010 at stone world bistro . fairly clear medium coppery hue with ruby highlights . fine , nitro-esque tan head provides good lacing . aroma is comparable to a fresh stone barleywine , meaning lots of wet herbal hop character and a smallish trace of bready , caramel malt . malt flavors of bread and caramel again remind me of an old guardian , that is until the hops hit . they have no doubt faded a great deal , but there is still an earthy hop character , grassy and citric . oh , and lots and lots of bitterness mouthfeel is quite dry , bordering on parching . this is actually a good thing , considering the big flavors this beer packs . a sipper , to be sure , but this is so similar to a barleywine ( to my palate , at least ) that it makes me wonder where stone is going with this one .

Review:
	ah , a classic barley-wine . even though there are certainly better , this was my first exposure to the world of barley-wines , so it has some sentimental value . clear , ruby-amber in color with a dark beige head and a <unk> consistency after a vigorous pour . head thins some-what but never disappears , perched atop medium-sized bubbles and medium-light carbonation . lacing is sparse . aroma is of a fruity fermentation , metals , sweet amber malts , butterscotch , and some phenolic alcohols . mouthfeel is not as smooth as i prefer , and cloying with a firm , sticky body . taste begins with initially harsh fermentation by-products , fades into a subtle metallic note , some tolerable alcohols , then gives way to the main attraction ... lots of sticky malts with caramelized sugars , raisin and date characters , and ending in a smooth , well-balanced lingering sweetness . a good example of the style but not my favorite . the metals and harsh initial mouthfeel detract from the enjoyment . as the beer warms , the alcohols and mouthfeel simmer , and the malt livens up , making for a much more enjoyable drink . i highly recommend to pour it first , then let it warm up to 55f before drinking it .

	i 've been hearing lots of good things about this beer , and it just came into town on the start of the new year . had to see what it 's all about . pours a nice deep amber with a nice frothy head that lasted just long enough for me to take a few good whiff , then settled down to a ring . has a nice , smooth smell to it , but nothing special . tastes just like it smells . a little tang at the end , but nothing disrupting . it 's just so smooth ... .it just fills your mouth up so nicely , you could really drink this all night with no problem . this is one solid built beer , very drinkable , but nothing extraordinary .

Review:
	blue start wheat is really my first delve into wheat beers . and thus i do n't have areal basis for comparison for this style , but i truely enjoyed it . a : pours a very hazy , pale yellow with a bubbly white head . low retention and lacing . s : light aroma . most smells were <unk> . t : crisp , slightly bitter , but overall very mild . m & d : light to medium mouthfeel and very drinkable . a perfect <unk> day beer . again , my first real experience with a wheat beer and it was quite enjoyable . i will definitely have this again and wil further explore this style .

Review:
	i was served this beer from the tap at the march 21 , 2008 session of the spring beer festival in portland , oregon . a : it poured a dirty yellow colored body with a robust two finger off white head that had decent retention and supported a balanced lacing s : it had aromas of sweet lightly toasted malts , with hints of caramel and the <unk> t : it began with sweet caramel malt flavors and creamy yeasty flavors . that was followed by minor citrusy flavors including lemons and oranges . it hid the alcohol well and was a bit thin on many flavors . m : it was a light bodied beer with modest carbonation and a sweet clean finish . d : nice ale but does not stand out as an outstanding beer . good session brew ... .but only one in a crowd .

Review:
	the first of many beers received from beerrun13 in a huge trade . big thanks to him for some great west coast brews i could never get here . very nice amber <unk> the white head on top . low aroma-sort of a nutty , sweet malt smell . toasted malt flavors . somewhat sweet . slighly bitter in the finish . decent enough mouthfeel . above average drinkability but i dont find this as well done as their pale ale . i have a second bottle so will re-think my review when i have that .

Review:
	i picked this beer up on a whim as i was in the mood for a good coffee stout and the <unk> figure somehow told me this is the beer for you . a bit freaky , but i went with it . i was impressed from the very first pour . like any stout , the color is a dark molasses black . but ... the head was thick and dense with good retention . the coffee aroma was intense ! the roasted goodness almost overwhelms my sense of smell . the roasted coffee flavors are the first things that i could taste along with hints of chocolate . however , i can tell there 's more complexity here than my palette can decipher . the coffee flavors bring bitterness but it 's not over powering as the sweetness of the malt cuts the bitterness quite nicely the beer has carbonation but once the bubbles have escaped the beer gives a creamy , velvety feel and finish . the alcohol was very well hidden in this beer which is scary . this is an amazing coffee stout . it is a very drinkable beer as it does not leave your mouth feeling bitter and dry ; it only leaves it wanting more .

Review:
	thanks grumpy for this extra . bottled in jan 09 and consumed 8 months past ( too long i know , but this is probably the only time i 'll ever try this beer ) . pours very dark for the style with a 2 finger head . smell is biscuity malts with caramel , dark fruits , orange , grass , belgian esters . taste is more of a barleywine at this point than a dipa , but i 'm really digging it . it 's not quite balanced considering how huge the malt backbone is compared to the subdued hops , but the flavor is excellent with pronounced caramel , melon , and orange . i would have loved to try this fresh , as it 's a very good beer with some obvious age on it .

Review:
	this is a very clear golden colored ale with a one inch white head . its aroma is mostly of yeast with a little spice and wheat . the flavor does not match the aroma at all ; this is much better than i expected judging by the smell . the belgian yeast is apparent and there are slight tones of alcohol and dark fruit . mouth feel is light bodied and highly carbonated . not too shabby .

Review:
	poured with a wonderful fluffy white chiffon like head seemed as if whipped to a light dense sculptured form that hovered over the beer 's surface . by the time i held my glass on high to gaze at the wondrous libation , that foamy fluffy froth active in the glass clung with a certain tenacity gracing the walls with a web , of lace and bubbles .. the room light reflected with rays of clear golden yellow-straw color , all the while bubbles materialized and darted to the surface with abandon . i was greeted by a yeasty , sweet nose- undertones of lemon and assorted hints of sweet natural fruity citrus tunneled through the head all the while spreading notes of malted grains . a background of alcohol kept the doors of beer perception cleansed ... . the flavor begins with a slightly sweet manner . after making it 's debut and receding into a bitter hint of a melodious compound of hops and malt -- i ca n't taste the oats , or the wheat or the barley , but their combination builds a wonderful flavor like a suspense novel that prods the reader to turning the <unk> this case the beer 's flavor prods me to taking sip after sip after.. the finish lingers with a boisterous note of citrus once again- the flavor and character of the beer stayed put upon my palate when enjoying karmeliet tripel , i keep trying to draw the last molecules of this beer from my empty laced glass .

Review:
	this stuff is about as dark as dark can get ... almost black . pours with a great , big head . it smells like it looks , roasted grain i was greeted initially with a vinegar taste . as the sips went by the flavor evened out , but my over all impression is that i 'm sitting here with a slightly over average beer . january 2012 i 'm giving this guy another try . no vinegar taste , i taste good ol ' roasty malt met with just the right balance of hop bitterness and the bitterness you get from charred grain .

Review:
	a- pours a <unk> macro color , nice foamy white head with decent lacing as slowly fades . not the best looking beer i 've seen ... s- huge citrus in the nose - mostly orange , hops as well , a nice smelling ipa t- hops come first followed by large pine notes and small hints of the malt which are then cancelled out by the nice bitter finish . wait to take my next sip m- carbonation is good , lighter side of medium , real easy drinking beer . some good dryness left in the mouth ... even at 8.2 abv it feels like a beer i could session ... watch out o- not a 'great ' dipa , but certainly very good . has a good nose and some depth in flavor while continuing to remain hoppy and bitter ( which is how i like it ) , carbonation and mouthfeel are good and since it is fairly local i can get them fresh which makes it all the <unk> a brew that i would buy in a 6 pack <unk> '

Review:
	had this in a small sniffer , which i found was absolutely perfect for the style ... thanks for the tip rob from smokeless ! pours a sinister black with a dark brown head that vanishes rather quickly but leaves a black ale with red edges in the light . aroma was roasted malts , chocolate , coffee , rather earthy like most rogues i have tried . taste was a dry bitterness , coffee , dark chocolate , ridiculously long finish , fantastic . very rish mouthfeel , syrupy and smooth . dangerously drinkable , and very potent . good show rogue as always !

Review:
	i love dogfish beers , but i ca n't say i feel this one at all . in fact , out of all the dfh beers i 've had , this one stands out as my least favorite it pours a pretty pale amber color and it smells really good . it 's a very unique smell - lots of spice and a whole lot going on . however , this definitely does not translate to great taste . i thought this beer tastes like it has way too much going on . i ca n't get a handle on what flavors are supposed to come through and they all end up mixing together in a pretty unmanagable combination for me it has a mouthfeel very similar to a miller lite ( which i do n't think is a real beer ) and overall just does n't work for me . like i said , i am a huge fan of dfh , but i think they missed the mark on this one . but hey , the girl i date likes it , so maybe it 's just me .

Review:

Review:
	a bit of a disapointment in that this porter tastes very similarly to their brown ale that i had earlier . the roasted malt character is greater in the porter , but other than that , it 's the same beer -- taste-wise . the beer is a bit thin and watery , thus lacks creaminess , boldness , and never becomes characterful . this was acceptable with the lighter brown ale , but i expect more from porters . it looks like a <unk> cola with light carbonation and lacking head retention . smells caramel malty and mildly roasty . modesty chocolate / coffee notes pepper the beer slightly , but not enough to make a meaningful impact . thin and weak in the body with a mild yeastiness . finishes slight of grainy , but fairly clean .

Review:

Review:
	a ceramic 750ml bottle of the 2008 vintage that was shared at an impromptu tasting . poured into a tulip glass . the pour is syrupy and thick . i can tell that this is going to be thick just from watching it pour . the body is garnet amber accentuated by ruby highlights in the light . there is ample head , and it leaves spotty lacing . swirls produce wine-like legs that creep back into the beer . the aroma is dominated by boozy warmth , caramel , nutty malts , and a hint of vanilla . the taste is similar , but more complex . caramel , toffee , and some nuttiness is joined by piney hops . cherry notes also make a quick appearance before they give way to vanilla in the finish . thick , sticky , and syrupy , this has a lot of potential , but i would hold onto another one for a couple more years before opening it , to give it more time to mellow .

Review:
	a 750 ml corked and caged bottle with foil around the mouth . i bought this at liquid solutions over a year ago , so i am hoping that the hops have held up . a : the ale opened with a slight pop . a pour into my mug yielded a 2 finger swatch of foamy head that has clung precariously to the sides . the ale is a darker amber color , showing off hints of copper red . haziness throughout the glass dulls the color a bit . s : the nose has a thick vinous aroma punctuated with some oily hops and an alcohol aroma that does n't hide its strength . t : it seems that my fears have been realized . the hops have settled down significantly , casting a muted flavor in the mouth . the barrel aging has imparted a sweeter flavor to the ipa , adding some vanilla bean flavors and a sweet white grape flavor . graininess overtakes the last half of the sip and , in conjunction with the chardonnay profile , creates a sweet mouthfeel that could pass for a belgian ipa . m : the mouthfeel starts off promising , hits some belgian ipa notes midway through but never really hits the hoppy notes that i was hoping to see . interesting but not extraordinary . d : the abv is high but there is a large flavor profile that keeps the tastebuds interested . worth a look for its uniqueness .

Review:
	inviting copper color with a sticky , if thin , head . caramel and apricots in the nose . wheat , dried apricots , caramel , and a dry finish . some lingering banana , too . the hops provide a late , but pronounced character . pretty tasty . i would n't say it 's as outstanding as others from southern tier like pumking and creme brulee stout , though

Review:
	on tap at the sunset . presented hazy , light gold , with a merange , white head . exceptional retention , ring-like lacing all the way to the bottom . aromatics are lively , zesty , and enticing . phenols with spice and fruit . coriander , orange peel , cardamon , and some slight cracked pepper accent the triple- type nose . some slight tartness is in the background , a shadow behind the bubblegum and spice . nose finishes with warming zest and vanilla . lightish body , crisp and snappy , with creamy carbonation . pallet starts off with some wheat tartness and husky zest . as the brew warms , it shows itself to closely resemble a double white , with triple-like character . well integrated citrus , clove , and lemon zest , work well with a bannana accent . finishes warming , crisp , and soft . extremely well balanced and drinkable , possibly the best brooklyn offering i 've tried .

Review:
	sierra nevada juniper black ale is an opaque , pitch black ale with a huge , fluffy , lumpy , light brown head that has incredible longevity and leaves clumps of foam on the glass . the aroma is grassy and hoppy . it seems a little muted by the head , but it 's still strong . there is a note of resiny sweetness . it 's medium bodied and quite smooth . the finish is dry and leaves the tongue a little dusty . it tastes a little bit sweet and quite bitter . the juniper is really prominent and it 's backed by resiny pine and ashy roast . this has a lot of flavor . this setting works really well for the juniper . the aftertaste is drier and has more dark roast . this is a bold beer in many ways . it looks , smells and tastes like a beer lover 's beer . outstanding brew

Review:
	multiple attempts at a hard pour all fail to yield anything but a slight and still incomplete head on this rust-amber colored beer . i even tried , unsuccessfully , to produce a head by swirling the beer around and then pouring it from a first glass to a second one . no noticeable lacing . initially the nose is mildly floral , with hints of lemon zest and bubblegum , but it becomes a bit sour as the beer warms . the taste of this brew was disappointing . an initial hoppy bitterness is familiar and appropriate for an ipa , but the dry finish is too sharp and astringent , with some lingering smokey and ash-like earthy notes that seem harsh and out of place note : although it 's possible that i 've simply gotten ahold of a bad batch , i should note that this six-pack was purchased from the refridgerated section of a large and respectable store , in a <unk> area within an hour 's drive from the brewery .

Review:
	a couple of ( generous ) samplers . it now seems as if this is to be the replacement of the downtown honey brown beer at olde main ( since late spring 2006 ) . clear and light-straw in appearance , yet not entirely devoid of color . smells like ... not much -- maybe a hint of malts , hops , and/or grasses -- but at least it 's not obnoxious . taste-wise , it 's something like a watered down czech pilsner . light-bodied and relatively smooth . about as drinkable as water . brewed with care ... but not for discriminating customers . according to bar personnel , this is olde main 's in-house alternative to miller lite , etc . granted , it 's much better than such swill , but that does n't mean it 's any good . basically if you 're reading beeradvocate.com , you 'll have no interest in having a pint of this .

Review:
	i actually avoided this for a long time , because the label looks like album art from a bad 80 's metal band . once poured , it 's beautiful . golden color with a cascade of carbonation , and a thick pillowy head . the smell is great , with a rich spiciness and some cedar and a trace of hops . the taste is also <unk> , with a banana flavor stepping forward as it warms . unfortunately , the taste score was affected by the fact the hops are too prevalent , especially for the style . a little more time in the bottle would n't hurt , but it 's a fine tasting beer with a pleasant but unremarkable mouthfeel . drinkable , certainly , but wo n't find it 's way onto my desert island list .

Review:
	reviewed from notes poured from a 22oz bomber , into highball glass ... ( sigh ) should 've brought my own glassware on vacation . pours a crystal clear yellow . big , fluffy head , recedes to a persistent layer of fuzz on top . smell is certainly a blend of the styles , but surprisingly to me , the belgian yeast overpowered the hop elements . taste - i had initially hoped for 75 % ipa , 25 % belgian , i got the reverse and was still quite pleased . front end is very tripel-esque , but the back-end hops continue to creep in and keep the palate off balance overall , nice mash-up , very glad i got to try it .

Review:
	presentation : comes in a green , 50 cl can with the jenlain logo , a description of the beer in a number of languages , and large text describing <unk> malt . ' poured into a pint glass . appearance : pours a solid , blonde/gold , a little bit more copper-colored than a typical american macro lager . decent head with weak retention , but as the head disappears it leaves behind a good amount of lacing . smell : bready aroma with a slight hint of malt . unfortunate vegetable smells , especially a strong corn presence . taste : cloyingly sweet nose with overpowering vegetable taste . a hint of hop bitterness follows but fails to salvage the beer . no real finish , and a horrible lingering aftertaste of sweet vegetable flavors . as the beer warms , a little bit more bitterness helps balance the sweetness , but again , it 's not enough . mouthfeel : slightly below average , very thin . drinkability : i 'm glad i picked up a can of this instead of going for the 65 cl bottle . far too sweet to handle in large , or even small quantities . a huge disappointment from brasserie duyck after the excellent jenlain <unk> de garde . i 'm still interested in trying their <unk> du printemps , but i 'll steer clear of the blonde in the future .

Review:
	fresh 12oz bottle of the 2011 vintage poured into a dfh pint glass . a - pours a clear , dark copper with a huge creamy head of slightly off-white foam that hangs around for some time , leaving soapy lacing as it eventually dissipates . s - sweet caramel malt and fresh , pungent hops with just the slightest whiff of apricots . you can tell this is a fresh bottle , the hop aromas are unbelievable t - very similar to the nose , fairly typical dfh ipa flavors of pungent hops and sweet caramel malt , but with a nice amount of apricot flavoring that really comes out in the finish . let 's be honest , this is more or less 60 minute with some apricots added , but it 's a darn tasty spring brew . m - slightly creamy , with a medium mouthfeel and moderate carbonation . d - like i said , this is a great <unk> beer , and i can see myself having many before it disappears from the shelves .

Review:
	on tap at the grey lodge . the beer pours a very deep , dark brown color with a nice thick white head the aroma of the beer is very complex with definite tones of the spruce in it and spicy notes . the taste is a nice roasted malt base with definite taste from the spruce . it is an odd ingredient to have but i really enjoyed it and would like to try it again . the beer is pretty drinkable but i think i could only have a few in a night . maybe get a bottle or 2 to keep for awhile . thanks to ben franklin .

Review:
	poured into a goblet a rich dark amber almost brown with ruby highlights when held up to the light . there was a beautiful two-finger head that was slow diminish and left great lacing on the glass . the aroma was very strong of cherries and <unk> , almost like cheerwine ! taste was absolutely wonderful . the vibrant cherry flavor was accented with a complex malt flavor and very subtle hops that were almost unnoticeable , but they did their job . this beer was vibrantly carbonated , once again , almost feels like cheerwine in the mouth . it is very hard to tell that this is 9.8 % alcohol . i 'd have to say , this is almost certainly my favorite beer made with fruit . very enjoyable any time of year .

Review:

Review:
	pours a decent head ( about a finger and a half ) considering the alcohol percentage . body is fairly opaque and is orange to amber . smells lightly of hops , plus some alcohol and malt . flavor starts off really sweet , then finishes with hoppy notes and a bit of a wine-like quality . definitely not as hoppy as i was expecting , but that 's ok here ; the flavors work together pretty well . it seems really smooth , especially given the amount of alcohol in it ( there 's definitely a nice warming note ) . overall , it 's not something i 'd be likely to get again soon , especially given the price , but it 's still decently tasty ( though it verges on being too sweet at times ) .

Review:
	lightly murky butterscotch . the massive head is ecru in color with a yellowish tint and looks to have the consistency of an excellent lace maker . fooled again ; an underwhelming number of smallish chunks end up on the glass while a stiff mesa of foam sits defiantly in the center of the glass , refusing to fall lower than a few fingers . clove is the first aroma that i notice , but there are others present as well , including fermented apples and pears with an underlying mustiness , hay and a hint of white pepper . the beer has a pleasant flavor with a mild sourness and a clove-like yeastiness that marks it as a belgian . or in this case , a belgian-style ale the spicy fruitiness lasts the longest , but is n't as supported as it could be due to the light body . for that reason , rare vos is more subtle than many of its style brethren . it fades from modestly sweet early to modestly dry late and leaves the palate clean . the light , airy , well-carbonated mouthfeel makes drinking easy and burping frequent . i like rare vos marginally more than i liked <unk> squared ' , but it is n't great beer in my mind . it is n't overly complex and the flavor profile does n't push my buttons all that hard . i 'm still glad that i gave it a try .

Review:
	on-tap at tustin a : the pour is a dark amber color , bordering on mahogany with a finger 's worth of slightly off-white head . s : wow , the nose on this beer is phenomenal . tons of vanilla , bourbon , maple syrup , brown sugar , caramel , and toffee provide a wonderful sweetness . some miscellaneous dark fruit notes and chocolate fill in the background of the aroma . t : the flavor is similarly impressive . lots of sweet , rich vanilla , bourbon , and oak accompanied by toffee , caramel , brown sugar , and maple syrup . the finish is all that prevents this from a perfect score as there is a bit of alcohol and heat , but there are some nice hints of chocolate . m : the mouthfeel is smooth , creamy , rich , and full bodied . a light but nearly perfect level of carbonation . d : i was told this beer was good , but i had to see for myself . this is one of , if not the , best barrel aged barleywines i 've come across . i might go back again soon to have some more .

Review:
	very dark for the beer style , dark brown beer that ca n't pass enough light to see the clarity with a good brown colored head . quite fruity and spicy smelling , ginger and clove on dried raisins and prunes . brown sugar and raw apple with a bit of cake batter malt aroma but the spice tries to hide it . the taste starts out sweetened prunes and coffee with the aftertaste of clove . strong coffee flavors here as if this was 50 % stout . strong bitterness for the style , more than a little hop . mouthfeel is ok . an ok beer but i did n't find this to be memorable .

Review:
	i know i committed a faux pas , but poured this from a 11.2 oz bottle into a pint glass ; however , i do n't think it overly affected my impression of it . anyway , the beer poured a light caramel color and had no head and virtually no lacing . it looked kind of thin too . the smell was amazing- dark fruit , caramel , malty but a bit boozy too . of course with 14 % alcohol you probably should expect that . the beer was crazy sweet with caramel and figs coming through to me . despite it appearing to be thin the beer had a nice thick coating mouthfeel and a bit of carbonation , so it was n't totally like drinking syrup . i do n't think i could do more than one of these in a sitting , but definitely worth a try if you 're into big sweet , malty , beers

Review:
	bought this from south bay drugs and liquor . served cold , probably too cold , which one should take into consideration while reading this ... poured a murky , <unk> brown , caramel edges when held to the light , slowly forming head with a short-lived but impressive cascade resulting in a finger of tan foam not too much here , serving temp might have something to do with it , the usual caramel and raisin of a wee heavy , sweet wine scent overwhelming chewy raisin flavor , if concentrate really hard , capped with a scotch ale smokiness some nice chewy body that finishes closer to watery it was difficult to finish this one , a little to sweet , probably my last one

Review:

Review:
	beer review 100 a - pours a light somewhat hazy gold color into my pint glass with about one finger of head moderate retention and very nice lacing . s - strong aroma of hops , pine and grapefruit citrus notes as well as sweet malts . t - to me , this is a great tasting ipa . sweet malts , followed by a very nice pine and citrus hop fusion that finishes with just the right amount of bitterness m - medium in body , crisp and refreshing . d - this drinks great as an ipa , and all you hopheads out there like myself remember this is an ipa , not a double or imperial , and for the category it 's in it is an awesome beer

Review:
	12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass - a - pours a transparent , pale golden color . the head is pale white with no cream , one finger 's height , and abysmal retention . i looked away for a few seconds and the head was gone s - stale cereal grains dominate . hardly any other notes to speak of . very mild in strength t - sharp corn/grainy notes throughout it 's entirety . watery , and has no hops characters or esters to be found . very simple ( not surprisingly ) m - highly carbonated and crisp on the front with a smooth finish d - yes , it is drinkable , but there are certainly better choices , even in the cheap american adjunct beer category . hell , at least drink original coors .

Review:
	dark amber and crystal clear . impressive head that recedes in a rocky fashion , leaving rings of chunky lace on the glass . nice blend of crystal malt and fresh hop . there 's a mild fruitiness to aroma ... in an attractive way . creamy flavor with a small amount of sweetness . this is quickly lost in a hop bomb rush . this continues through the swallow and long into the aftertaste . the body is surprisingly thin , but it does not take away from the powerful flavors . could be described as a weak-bodied dipa .

Review:
	mostly clear ( just a slight haze ) dark golden color . this beer is interesting , but not particularly good . its aroma is a mix of blueberry cereal and wheat malt . it 's a grainy , cereal-like , dryish smell . the blueberry is prominent , but seems artificial . the taste is semi-sweet , with the berry flavor consistent throughout . nearly no bitterness . medium-low heft , with an simple finish . slight acidity creeps in at times , but it 's definitely a secondary characteristic in this beer

Review:
	sampled : <unk> pours a slightly hazy dark ruby tinted copper . thick 1.5 inch eggnog head hangs out and fades gracefully . the aroma is hardcore barley malts , sweet and rich with caramel . hints of the alcohol level sneak in as well . the taste is lower in the barley flavor than the nose indicates . a tanginess followed by a bitter and oily mouth coating of hops finishes of the flavors . medium carbonation sits decently in your mouth . hop oils hang out after each sip . this is a slow goer , made to sip and savor . it was n't my favorite barleywine style ale i 've had to date , but that does n't make it bad by any means . and it 's definitely a good local offering . ( to me in ma ) i 'd like to see what some time would do with this . i think some sweet maltiness could really come through .

Review:
	one of my favorite ipa 's poured a light amber , cloudy orange with dashes of gold , completed by a full head of white foam . leave considerable lacing throughout the drink . beautiful aroma of citrus and floral hops . taste is very interesting ; big time apricot sweetness then boom ! , a crash of hops of refined design . the hops are so clean and crisp you can almost feel your tongue crackle . perfect carbonation and no alcohol in the flavor . aftertaste is of light fruit and bitter hops , but finishes without approaching the disastrous realm of metallic <unk> . a nice one ...

Review:
	750 ml . bottle , corked and caged . 2007 bottle conditioned ' pours a slightly hazy dark chestnut body with copper highlights and an orange glint . the frothy tan head holds remarkably well and leaves craggy rings of lace with each sip the nose is clearly smoky , expressing beechwood , amidst a sweet , bready , toasty , and caramelish maltiness . in the mouth it 's medium-full and lightly creamy with a very fine-bubbled , natural , median carbonation that leaves it smooth and easy to drink . the flavor is as the nose suggests , with a good amount of smokiness , but not soo much that it 's overdone . it works well to complement the maltiness , and lends an overall depth to the beer that would otherwise not be possible as it enhances the complexity of the malt . some floral and spicy hops make an appearance at the swallow , and it finishes dry . surprisingly , the smokiness does n't build on the palate in a negative way . it lingers , but very nicely . really nicely done . quite enticing in its balance and complexity . certainly worth seeking out for fans of beechwood smoked malt - one of the best i 've had

Review:
	anytime i see an offering from north coast i have n't sampled its a no brainer to put it into the stable . this reminds me to make a point of planning a trip north for some great breweries soon pour is easily manageable , forms a big brown head that is meaty , chunky and clings to the glass , dries and forms crispies ... damn nice , near perfect . lots of coffee , burnt aroma . comes across with a nice woody burnt flavor that has a counterpunch of bitter hops . bitterness is on the high end of the scale for a stout and it works well . charred taste lingers a bit and gives it a dry finish . some chalkiness but nothing to hold back a fine brew another winner from a fine brewery .

Review:
	a : dark pour , pretty much black with a light brown head that looks pretty nice for being higher abv . s : oak is very evident . bourbon , chocolate , molasses , vanilla and dark malts . smells pretty good . t : oaky , chocolatey and bourbon are the main flavors . a bit of roasted malt , vanilla and molasses too . a touch of hops can be found near the finish . bourbon flavor shows itself more in the finish . a bit rough around the edges , but still good . m : body is a bit light for being a big beer . a tad creamy . lower carbonation d : pretty good for being a barrel aged high abv ale . not sure what the age is on this one , but it seems fairly fresh since the bourbon flavors are still very evident and a bit powerful . by far , this is got ta be the best offering from cold spring brewery .

Review:
	poured into my sam adams perfect pint glass . a was a clear orange staw color with a 1 finger white head . s this smelled like a cherry pie coming out of the oven , with the strong tart cherry filling and wheat crust , no wonder my wife calls this a cherry pop tart . t & m the cherries blended very well with the wheat malt making it lightly tart yet very refreshing . the beer held it carbonation well which also gave this beer more of the souring effect you would want in a fruit beer that i never realized before . d this is a good summertime beer for those who enjoy fruit beers with a sourness to them , but do n't want to spend the extra money on the richer belgian fruit beers . i enjoyed it . after reading some of the other reviews , i really believe you have to drink this beer out of the perfect pint glass from sam adams to really appreciate this beer .

Review:
	the first time i tried this beer out of the bottle i was <unk> at it . the pour definatly doesnt look like a traditional white ale but that is where the <unk> stops . the smell has the traditional spice to it . corriander comes to the top , something familiar but yet not able to nail it down . it feels like an old friend . the mouth feel is just about right , effervecent as a wheat should be but not too over the top . and drinkable , you bet . refreshing but not heavy as some wheats can be . it is almost a summer beer but at the same time would be nice on a cold winters nite by the fireside not that i would remember what that is like living in <unk> for the past 11 years .

Review:
	on tap at the brewpub ( <unk> , fish out the lemon slice ) ... cloudy , hazy pineapple color ( not as thick as some ) , decent 1/4 inch pale white head of two primary bubble sizes . sheet laces with some traction . fresh grassy ester aromas , not too cloying or artificial . lots of apple accompanies the expected banana flavors , fresh but there 's a lack of the spiciness of some . finishes slightly lemony with the requisite loads of aftertaste . as usual , the profile suffers from great water 's tendency to serve its pushed beers too friggin ' cold ( surprising for a brewpub with four cask beers on tap year round ) -- but this is a serviceable hefe in most characteristics .

Review:
	first off , thanks to brad for <unk> this one up for us . very generous poured into a tulip glass a golden hued honey color with a slight haze to it . not a whole lot of head to speak of though . the aroma is extraordinary and complex with notes of sour fruit , tart , and apple . the taste does not dissappoint . sour apple , tartness , and a subtle oak flovor overwhelm the palate mouthfeel is light . the drinkability of this is exceptional if you get the chance , try this beer . very good

Review:
	jackman 's american pale ale ... appearance-thick orange color , little bit of gold , thin carbonation and barely any bubbles . smell-sweet hop and malt aroma that is well balanced , alcohol well hidden . taste/mouthfeel-more malty than hoppy but still fairly light , somewhat sweet but fairly balanced , alcohol is well hidden once again . <unk> normal pale ale , quite drinkable . overall-an ok apa , i 'm not going to take it out on this one , but i do find myself tiring of the style . still , this beer is fine and well-made , it just does n't separate from the pack .

Review:
	poured from a 12oz . bottle into a tasting glass . the color is a clear orange/gold with a finger of foamy white head and some slight lacing left on the glass . the smell is a bit hoppy but with malty sweetness that was a bit surprising . there is even a slight spicy flavor that gives a bit of a zing to the nose . the taste is big bitter hop flavor with a good sized alcohol flavor . there is some fruit flavor there that is a little piney flavor mixed in . it is hard to draw on much since there is such a large bitterness there is also some sweet malt flavor that comes out when your able to get past the hops and alcohol . the feel of this beer is big all around . the force of this beer as it <unk> your pallet is something else . i had to take my time with this one . i had a small glass but it still took me a while to get through the little i had . this must be the bitterest beer i have had even though i never did check the ibus .

Review:
	batch 005 a : a hazy yellow pear color , the head is a nice white color . looks good s : strong acidic aroma , vinegar is pretty strong in there as well . there is almost a light citrus thing going on that is nice t : a tart punch hits right away , after the sour fades , there is a slight touch of some funkiness , the finish has a very nice floral note with hints of lemon . very nice m : light on the tongue , tons of carbonation which is mostly comprised of small bubbles o : overall quite lovely , not so burn you tongue sour that you ca n't taste the base beer . there is something so simple , so brilliant about this . it is a quite complex beer , but seems to be so without really trying .

Review:
	got this at massey hall after seeing the <unk> orchestra . came a dark gold , autumn leaf colour with a sliver of a head . but the bartender poured it improperly . with the glass being a small size , i doubt she could have poured a decent head on it without it overflowing . barley grain smell . a little sweet , a little weak . kinda bland tasting . sweet , chewy malt , odd aftertaste . it was n't bitter , it was sour ( sour is the best word i could use to describe , and that is n't very close . thin mouthfeel . the chewy malt adds a little texture to the brew . overall , it 's okay . i 've had better , i 've also had worse . but next time i 'm at massey hall , i 'll order a guinness , or maybe a beck 's if i have n't had it already .

Review:
	a : pours a reddish amber color with an initial one finger head . thin head of retention left after the initial head dissipates . nice lacing . s : sweet malt with a grassy hop presence that balances it out . caramel malt with biscuit like characteristics t/m : sweet caramel malt notes . biscuity malt profile takes over followed by a twang of grassy hops . bitterness is subtle , but still very noticeable . medium body , which is quite nice . smooth and extra soft on the palate -- possibly a tad buttery . d : smooth , soft , tasty , and easily drinkable . solid amber in a can from new england . get a six pack for that next outing on a boat . ca n't go wrong with this one . through the bridge on the merritt from my home town -- support your local brewery

Review:
	nothing standout-ish about the appearance , yellow with some gold . small head . smells of fruit and danger ... hops and grain prominent as well . overall , disarming . hopped to death . can be overwhelming . i would n't mind drinking more , as long as there 's one handy . i would n't move mountains to get another .

Review:
	pours two thick fingers of tan froth on a dark brown body . good nose , with caramel and brown sugar sweetness arising to greet it . the taste blends the sweetness with a dash of hopped bitterness well . well carbonated , this is a sturdy , very drinkable beer that has joined me for much leisure time . i wo n't apologize for that ; nor will you after a couple brown ales .

Review:
	served in a budweiser pokal . pours a clear dark amber brown with a pale oatmeal head that leaves a good amount of lacing behind . the smell is lightly roasted malts , with light hints of chocolate , anise , and wheat . the taste brings back those roasted malts , starting off light and becoming increasingly roasted as the taste floods across the tongue . there 's a healthy amount of wheatiness in their as well , not unlike a dunkelweizen with less yeastiness . a slight <unk> quality is also present , but very subdued . the body is on the lighter side and very smooth , allowing this brew to live up to its name .

Review:
	pours with a <unk> head and it dissipated almost as fast . nice amber colored body . the aroma is sweet malt , citrusy hops . flavor is like that of the bastard child of an apa and an esb . a slight sourness to the aroma and flavor . slick moutfeel . basically , they 've taken a pretty run-of-the-mill apa and labeled it as a scottish ale . being not even a really good apa and a horrendous halfassed attempt at a scottish i ca n't give this a very high rating . i will say that it 's not a bad beer , though .

Review:
	octoberfest : say the word and you probably think of lederhosen , big parties with communal tables , beer girls dressed in traditional garb , and a brew like this . i sure did so when i saw this available via the single bottle , i figured that this would be a great brew to enjoy the season with , even if i could n't get to a real event like those in germany attend every year . like so many others on here , i was let down by this beer from the moment i poured it out . i know that marzens are n't the highest rated brews on here , but i do expect an imported offering like this to have some taste , body , and drinkability to it light pour to this was a good head and lacing that was better than expected . those were the best aspects of this beer as the aroma was practically nonexistent and the head faded fairly quickly . marzen 's tend to be a bit thin in the mouthfeel for me but even this did n't match up to my <unk> expectations . there was straw , grass , and floral notes to this beer but i could n't wonder how much of the taste had to do with the green bottle . sure enough , this tasted skunked as soon as i took a sip and because this had n't been on the shelf that long , i think that spoke more about the beer than the presentation of it . further tasting of this led me to wonder what style it was , since it reminded me of an adjunct lager in every aspect . the filler seemed less than up to standards and the aftertaste was sour enough to beg for a chaser - any type that would alleviate the lingering and uneasy bitterness i have no idea how something this bad could be so strong in the alcohol department . this is not the kind of beer i would want to get drunk on and even though the carbonation did n't detract from the taste , this was n't something that i could down very quickly . maybe i 'm not up to snuff on my appreciation of this style but after seeing how low this was rated on here , i 'm thinking that this beer is about a big a letdown as they get .

Review:
	12 oz silver foiled bottle . 5.7 % alc . pours god 's gold , an incredibly clear , bright color that looks alot like a piece of gold when in the dimpled mug . the head is large , white , and foamy and sticks for awhile . it smells very clean but robust for the style . it is very bready with not much sign of hops . it is quite sweet with a subtle fruitiness , the grains are sweet as well . not much in the way of hops , just a minuscule amount of bitterness . if you want a lesson in non bitter but still refreshing beer this is it . if it did n't have so much flavor it would be a rousing success in the us . the drinkability is at high levels

Review:
	a : crystal clear amber , rim of bubbles , minimal lace . s : strong musty funk , very chemical like nail polish , paint thinner , motor oil , granny smith apples , hard cider . t : like biting into a lemon ... that 's full of stomach acid . waves of funk and sourness , first on the tongue , then the rest of your palate and throat catches up and you get a second shock on the swallow and aftertaste . my initial unconscious reaction is to spit it out , like my mouth is saying 'you should n't be drinking this ! by the time i 'm able to right myself and convince my throat to swallow i 'm already regretting it . but like vegetables , anchovies and many other things i 've grown -- and learned -- to like ( or even love ) , i can already feel this one growing on me . still , it is like what i imagine the acid blood of the alien alien would taste like before it melted you face off . m : light body and carbonation , very sharp and crisp with a bone dry finish . d : not my favorite gueze experience so far , and though i 've definitely had more drinkable guezes , or at least ones i prefer , i 'm also new to this style i feel it 's important to hold off passing judgement until i 've accustomed my palate to these beers . what i will say though is that this beer gave me heartburn .

Review:
	throws a chill-hazed golden . thin white head retreats to virtually nothing immediately , but leaves some nice lace work down the side of the glass . hoppy nose with citric notes . pleasant , but not alot to speak of . taste begins with the hops . definately herbal . a light , but solid malt base keeps things in check , leaning slightly in the carmel direction . hops reappearing to mop up at the finish . leaving some tea-like notes and some lemon twang . fairly light bodied . very drinkable and refreshing . leaps and bounds better than their hefeweizen . this is a solid offering . thanks , bighuge

Review:
	a - amber/orangish with a decent sized off-white head . s - malty and caramel/toffee with very slight hints of fruit . classical british smells in pale ales . t - caramel and toffee along with very slight nuttiness are the main flavors . there is some buttery taste as well . slight apple and honey . the normal british flavors of <unk> but a little lackluster and watery . m - fairly light and thin but also quite smooth . d - easy to drink and nothing offensive , a lot like a lot of british beers in terms of sessionability ( however the flavor does n't quite match some of those great british session beers ) . notes : this is one of those beers that is a good stepping stone and introduction . shows off the typical flavors that you think of in british beers , just not as well as some other good ones .

Review:
	poured from a bottle into a pint glass . a : pours a ruby amber color with 1/4 ' thin head and some lacing . this is a good looking beer . s : floral hops and citrus burst into the nostrils . some slight malt and pine aromas also present . t : sweet citrus flavors dominate the initial sip followed by a significant hop presence in the middle to finish . some slightly unappealing bitter aftertaste in the finish . m : this beer has the feel of a good spring beer . it is light and thin on the tongue with the presence of prickly carbonation . overall this is a good beer . it is very similar in flavor to nugget nectar , but the flavors and character are not as prominent as in its imperial amber ale cousin . aside from the slightly bitter aftertaste , the beer is well balanced and one of the tastier amber ales that i have had .

Review:

Review:
	tangerine pour with a small white head that clings to the edge of the glass . the aroma is comprise mostly of soapy , resiny hops - far from a punch in the face of west coast bitterness , and not all that impressive compared to others within the style . malty flavour and not all that hop-oriented . the hopping is smooth and mild , but the bitterness does gradually build , although it reminded me more of an english bitter instead of an american ipa . the malts come out as fruity with some honey . medium-light body with decent carbonation . i ca n't give it a glowing review because its not a great beer . pyramid seems to be very hit and miss , and this is a miss . inspite of this , it still makes a damn drinkable beer and beats the living crap out of the major brands . thanks mark

Review:
	the presentation was nothing bold , the beer was black - no question about it , but lacked a good decent finger of head . the head was minimal and light tan . smell was average for any other brewpub stout you might imagine . super dark roasted malt . taste was better then i thought it would be . very smooth drink with a bite during the finish , a certain spice that i could n't place but was very direct and i just burped another taste of it ( two hours later ) . average on everything else . this is a standard stout and i really do n't desire another .

Review:
	appearance - a murky caramel/brown brew . extremely bubbly , three fingers at least . fades back to a half-finger and holds there due to quite a bit of bead from underneath . aroma - powdery , grainy malts , not much more . taste - decent malts to start . a little sourish tasting but a bit of toast too . a mild brown sugar taste that comes across kind of funky . after a few sips , the malty side begins to dominate . the swallow has a nice abv warmth in the throat . mouthfeel - way too bubbly , interferes with the flavor , inhibiting the sweetness . i like the smoothness , though , and it has a good body on it . drinkability - not my favorite bock , but it drinks okay .

Review:
	12oz bottle poured into a dfh snifter glass a : pours a ruby/orange color with a one finger head that dissipated quickly leaving a little bit of foam on the top . decent lacing down the sides s : nice citrusy hops , lots of grapefruit on this one . get a hint oh booze on the nose as well t : fell a little flat compared to the nose . not has hopcentric as i was expecting . the hops are still there , but it is a whole lot weaker . just average imo m/d : medium bodied . overall it was fine , but nothing special for me .

Review:
	had this on tap at instant replay , review from notes a : served in a standard pint glass , the beer pours a clear straw yellow color with slight golden hue . the white head rose about a good inch in a half , but quickly settled , leaving minimal lacing s : scents of hops , a bit of lemon zest , grass , some mild wheat and malt in the background too t : initial flavor impression is a crisp , medium bitter bite , followed by a mild wheat malt backbone . some citrus , light herbs and hops , but overall just simple and refreshing m : medium body , crisp , with medium to high carbonation o : session beer for me . decent flavor , not to high in alcohol , refreshing , and goes down very easy , and fast on a hot day . however , being an american pale ale , it is light in flavors too , and not something , personally , that i would seek out per se when craving an alesmith beer , as so much of their other offerings offer a lot more complexity as well as flavor in my opinion . prefer speedway stout , or nautical nut brown when given their options . as for the this beer in style , good , but only above average for me .

Review:
	small somewhat creamy light brown head that mostly diminished . pitch black color . aroma of bread , molasses , caramel , chocolate , coffee , toasted malt . light alcoholic sniff , plum , prune , date , licorice . very complex aroma . full bodied with an alcoholic texture and a soft carbonation . excellent balance between the moderated sweet malt and bitter flavor . berries sweet and lingering finish . smooth and very nice thick beer . definitely one of my favorite ris .

Review:
	celebration was poured into a tulip glass . appearance- the head is almost silky and is about one and a half fingers of off-white with a yellow tinge . this one leaves great sheets of pillowy lace . the body is the color of orange rind with amber highlights . smell- the hop notes are estery and have a touch of floral to them . there is some slight citrus backed up by a sweet caramel malt . it smells great , but it is a little too subdued . taste- the hop bitterness is really great on this one and lasts throughout the drink . there is some sweeter biscuit malt accompanied with citrus and grassy hop flavors . it is a refreshing ipa . mouth feel- this one borders on a light and medium body . it certainly is not the creamiest ipa out there by any stretch of the imagination overall- this is a good ipa that i would recommend to anyone . the main thing to adjust would be the mouth feel by fixing the carbonation up , also get those great hop notes to really show up on the palate . the malt character is nice , but getting more of that floral hop in the flavor , for instance , would only help this ipa 's score .

Review:
	a fierce sound , clearly heralding something good , or at least , we hope ... hazy golden hue , fervent carbonation , with a huge , creamy white head atop , very attractive . citrus and spice in the nose , very bold and bright and uplifting with flavor ... pepper and clove , coriander , lemon zest ... like a witbier with a bit more cojones ... taste is fully flavored , juicy , zesty , spicy , brisk , bristling , brilliant ... with a certain sugary kick ... a little candy-ish , treacly , sticky-sweet ... but i ca n't help but like <unk> , a trifle thin , actually , ..but still good ... .a very nice tripel , if <unk> . <unk> tasty , zesty , sweet ... and a little bit strong , ... this lands in the good category , and that 's very fine .

Review:
	poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a chimay chalice . appearance : pours a hazy dark brown color with reddish hues around the laces . has a thick white head that dissipates slowly and leaves little lacing . smell : smells strongly of dark fruits and sweet malts . has that belgian yeasty smell too . taste : has a strong vinous taste . starts bitter and vinous and finishes sweet and spicy . has a noticeable alcohol flavor as well . mouthfeel : very smooth and full-bodied with a nice carbonation bite . drinkability : another great beer from chimay . the chimay line-up is one of the best in the world of beer . certainly worth a try and something i will look for in the future .

Review:
	<unk> on tap at a pub in bozeman , mt . presentation- from the tap into a tumbleweed ipa glass . appearance- amber pour with a nice 3/4 inch thick creamy head , and nice lacing . smell- nice typical ipa scent . fairly heavy pine and grapefruit scents . taste- nice flavor balance between the hops and the malt . more grapefruit flavor than pine . not to bitter . mouthfeel- good carbonation level . drinkability- a very drinkable ipa . not the best , but definitely above average . good balnaced brew that i would try again when in montana .

Review:
	another stone on <unk> one has proven to not be as uneven as some of the other styles . lovely dark shade , very dark ... you can pick up some reddish/brown when held to the light . very nice head when poured , plus it left lots of lovely lacing through-out the glass . light smokey aroma . nice chewey , medium bodied beer . this is one of their more balanced beers in my opinion , and it shows , the malt and hops blend well together , neither overshadowing the other . there 's some roasted flavor present in the malt as well . it leaves a smooth smokey aftertaste that is pleasurable . pretty good brew . not as smokey as some german smoke beers , so might be a way to introduce this flavor to someone

Review:
	poured this one from a growler filled at deschutes early evening based upon the suggestion of a pub server . i would n't have grabbed this otherwise -- i 'm glad he took the time to push me towards a good choice armory xpa is a predominantly reddish amber brew with a moderate head and minimum lacing . the scent on this one is fantastic , ranging from ripe banana , fresh cut grasses , and sweet toffee . it 's definitely treading towards an ipa with the citrus and pine profile , though the bitter hops are slightly more subdued in this one compared many of the pacnw ipa 's , softened by a tangerine-like sweetness . this is a great summer drinking option , light going down , with substantial carbonation . overall , i 'm definitely glad to have tried armory xpa , though i should caveat that if someone is looking for a profile that strays far at all from a pacnw ipa , they had best look elsewhere .

Review:
	the '05 gabf winner ... appears a copper toned amber with a lush ivory white head that sticks around . tons of lacing cling to the interior of the glass . smell is of a rich malt with toffee , hard candy , bitter hops , along with a sugary sweetness . taste is about the same of the aroma with a nice hop addition . mouthfeel is chewy , bitter , sweet , and semi-dry . this is a great rendition . one of the best american versions i 've had .

Review:
	pours a tarnished amber , large carbonation bubbles , and a giant rocky offwhite head . smells like bubblegum , cherries , and bread . there is also a wine smell , like what you would smell if you left a red wine bottle open for a few weeks with just a little bit in the bottom , kind of like wine yeast , i guess wow , that taste is all about that weird wine flavour . sweet , lingering aftertaste of <unk> bubblegum . wow , that upfront wacky flavour is really right there . it reminds me of the weird flavour in three floyds gumballhead mouthfeel is alright , a bit overcarbonated for my liking , but it does well to reinforce the wine/champagne aspects of this beer . this beer speaks for itself , if you like this style , you are going to get it , as it 's a bit of a classic .

Review:
	a : jet black , with red hues trying to peek through , but hard to capture , unless directly in the light . thick , creamy , dark tan head , good lacing . s : coffee up front , then one has to search for the bourbon , kind of disappointing , but still great scents . some nice chocolaty hints , along with vanilla . t : huge roasted malts , but matched with a <unk> sweetness . strong coffee presence , as the nose would lead on , then comes the delicious woody notes ; hints of vanilla . the bourbon is very much in the background , but the rest of the flavors are excellent . m : medium body , not too thick , but pretty smooth and almost creamy . no sign of alcohol in this beer . o/d : it 's a beer i wish i could have more of , but at the same time ... it did not live up to the hype . it 's delicious , but where 's the bourbon

Review:
	into a pint glass , poured a solid black , not so much head but enough , tannish in color , decent lacing down the glass . as for aroma , if you love coffee and beer , its the best of both worlds , a very fresh strong full roast coffee blended with ( and almost overtaking ) a solid , classic stout nose , with the toasty , chocolate malts . with the taste , its even more coffee , and while its my dream come true , so delicious , what with its nice chocolate and burnt malt tones again , but i almost say it overtakes any stoutiness , and takes away from the beeriness of this beer . which is n't to say it is n't delicious , because it is , just seems a bit unbalanced . oh well ! the mouth is pretty solid , a bit light but not all that unexpected with a coffee blend . its fairly smooth , not quite creamy , well carbonated , thoroughly , exceptionally drinkable .

Review:
	simply the best dark beer i 've found -- for my taste . much better than their porter . i 've brewed and purchased countless stouts . the only thing close has been a stout that i brew with a pound of honey and lager yeast . obsidian stout is best when a little warm ( 55 degrees ) . i usually drink it out of a glass that i got at the guinness brewery in dublin

Review:
	spending my day off catching up on some old reviews . the stack is pretty massive , just now getting around to winter beers . free sample from my lh rep . wish i could remember his name , but this was at least 6 months ago and i have n't seen the guy since . dark brown body . the aroma is all spice : nutmeg and coriander , not a good start . on the palate malt and hops take a back seat to spices . nutmeg forcefully controls this beer . no balance , just the baking spices that have unfortunately come to define too many winter offerings . the body was smooth and creamy , but this spice bomb was a drain pour for me . maybe its just my personal preferences , but this seemed completely out of balance and was not enjoyable .

Review:
	received in a trade with mrtopher . thanks chris a - pours a hazy amber color with thin off-white head . the head dissipates relatively quickly , but a few bubbles remain on top of the beer and a fair amount of lacing is left on the glass . s - intense citrus hop aroma balanced with some sweet caramel maltiness . t - starts with some pineapple along with some other citrus fruits . a very slight pine bitterness is noticeable for a brief second before some bready malts take over . excellent tasting dipa that is very easy to drink . m - slightly about average body with a perfect amount of carbonation . exactly what i would expect from a dipa . overall , a solid dipa . i do n't think it does anything to set itself apart from the other beers of the style , but you certainly ca n't go wrong with this easy drinking brew from drake 's .

Review:
	served from the bottle into a becker glass a-poured a semi-hazy orange color with a one finger soapy head s- very sweet floral , slightly citrusy aroma . smells like a clean pale ale t- very sweet floral taste , come citrus and herbal notes . finishes with a strong bitterness ( a <unk> bitterness ) . kind of faint in flavor . m- medium body , pretty high carbonation , pretty clean o- a clean ipa that reminds me more of a pale ale . the strong nondescript bitterness brings this beer down for me some , just not very flavorful either . not worth picking up , much better ipas out there .

Review:
	a : poured into a sierra nevada anniversary ale pint glass . body is clear golden with a 1-finger ivory-white head . very little in the way of visible carbonation , and what bubbles there are are slow to rise . leaves good splotchy lace s : very nice - tropical fruit , apricot and a touch of pine . may be a hint of cat pee too , so i knocked it down to 4 , ultimatley ; at first i thought 4.5 - 5 t : follows the nose , pretty much : tropical fruit ( pineapple ) , citrus ( grapefruit peel and lemon ) and apricot . reminds me at first blush of sculpin , but there 's a bit of spice at the finish , and some heat on the way down ( not terribly surprising given the 7.85 % abv ) , that distinguishes this one from sculpin . finishes with lingering spice , pine resin and tropical fruit m : given the light color , this one 's heavier in heft than anticipated - call it medium in weight ( also another area of difference with sculpin , which i keep coming back to due to that apricot taste and light coloring ) . slight slickness to the feel . o : good stuff . ventures away from the usual piney/citrusy hop bitterness and towards the apricot/tropical fruit taste ( and smell ) . nice surprise from lagunitas on that front .

Review:
	11.2oz bottle poured into a tulip glass . best by <unk> . appearance : clear golden yellow with lots of bubbles moving up through the beer . initial rocky white head ( 1/8 ' thick ) with some thin strands of lacing here and there , but the head is almost all gone by the end of the glass and so is the lacing , but i 'm really enjoying the color smell : yeast and fresh orange peel , but as the beer warms up the smell really diminishes taste : bready malt , yeast again , and a citric orange mild bitter finish . the finish starts to take on some more herbal and spicy notes as the beer warms up but the citric orange still dominates mouthfeel : good carbonation - cleanses the palate but does n't scour it . just a bit thick , but smooth overall / drinkability : nice and tasty . simple and straightforward , and a great looking beer to stare at while savoring . a solid good beer and i could easily see myself having another one .

Review:
	pours a light-ish golden brown , with a nice cream colored head . fair retention , lacing . smells good , but does n't quite smell like a doppelbock . faint malt with black tea , nondescript sweet fruits , alcohol tingle on a very deep whiff . taste is again good , but not what you expect in a bottle labeled doppelbock . a nice sweet maltiness up front , but with a strong piney and earthy hop presence . a little breadiness and green apple in the middle , a bit of alcohol tingle and a dry finish . relatively light body , but a lively feeling carbonation . i am torn , i really like this brew , but as a doppelbock it is a disappointment . without the style in mind i would rate this much higher . i will give drinkability a 5 , because it is good , just dont expect a doppelbock like you have experienced before .

Review:
	this poured a nearly opaque dark mahogany with a little light tan head . it smelled like light roasted barley with faint lemon hops and chocolate and smoke . it tasted like copper hops and burnt barley , with some bready yeast and lemon and a bit of dark chocolate . it was watery with moderate carbonation , and had a bitter aftertaste . overall this was n't very clean or tasty , with a weak scent and mediocre body . that all adds up to a disappointing beer that i would n't recommend unless you 're desperate to try another schwarzbier .

	pours a white one finger head that dissipates moderately quickly . crystal clear straw body , with a small amount of visible carbonation . slightly sweet corn scent . unremarkable taste . light on the hoppiness , does n't bring much to the palate . pretty one dimensional , but that 's pretty expected for an extra pale ale . very light watery mouthfeel , but not very crisp . goes down with very little trace . if you 're in the mood for a super light session beer that 's not too boring then this might be a better compromise than some of the other similar aals out there .

Review:
	semi opaque burnt orange pour in a tulip . thick , lump head dissipated pretty quickly . looks like a classic sn ... beautiful for about 30 seconds , then well , messy . spicy and very bright and floral in the nose ( high grade marijuana buds ) with malts present in the background . dried fruits and spices ... big fruity hops are abundant . earthy and grainy , the barley malts add a depth that surround the huge amount of hops beautifully . pine nuts and a tangy finish . dense , oily feel foamy on the tongue . this beer is really good . it really has the depth and hops of a double ipa . this is a well named brew . tastes and feels like a harvest . pairs nicely with turkey and cranberry salad . this is my second bottle this autumn and hope to have more

Review:
	not a great beer , but not bad . pours with a nice foamy frothy off white head that lasts and a little lace . color is an ever so slightly hazy amber . aroma is malty , grassy , hoppy , and bready beer . flavor 's very similar along with pretzels and with bitterness coming out at the end . good body and carbonation . finish is good . drinkable beer . could be a session .

Review:
	appears a slightly hazy , light gold with tons of co2 rising to the top . a 3 finger head of fluffy white foam gradually fades out . massive amounts of lacing is left behind . smell is of brown sugar , caramel , golden raisins , light vanilla , doughy yeast with notes of melons and bananas . flavor mimics the aromas with a yeasty , herbal taste with highlights of citrus , pears , and caramel . mouthfeel is full bodied , sweet , yeasty , slightly chewy with a lovely finish that makes you crave more .

Review:
	thanks to blake ( kickinthechalice ) for this beer appearance : pours a golden yellowish-orange color - almost like the stone soup beer ( which i just drank and reviewed ) except that it seems less dense and more translucent . the head is fizzy and maybe half a finger 's worth ... it dissipates quickly but the bubbles keep streaming up from the bottom aroma : smells like malts and wheat , maybe a little fruitiness in the background . between the pour and the aroma , this is shaping up to be a lot like stone soup , which i hope it is n't , because i did n't love that . this is a cream ale though , while stone soup is a belgian pale ... not sure why they appear so similar so far taste/mouthfeel : feels creamy in the mouth . thank god , unlike stone soup , i 'm not getting any strong lingering after taste - that 's totally not my thing . spotted cow feels very light and thin , which here is n't bad ... . to be honest , the flavor is n't very full , so i 'm having a difficult time rating it . i guess i mostly taste pale malts with a little hops notes : this beer is light and crisp and the drinkability is high . it 's nothing too special though , just a nice drinking beer , maybe best on a hot afternoon .

Review:
	honeymoon saison is a golden colored brew , with a medium-sized fluffy white head which sticks to your glass . the scent is sweet , with some honey , yeasty , candy , spiciness , some clove , maybe a touch of apple . taste starts light and sweet , bit of honey with lots of spicy pepper , clove , some fruit notes , orange and lemon , maybe a touch of apple . very spicy aftertaste , just a touch of sourness , slight tartness . medium bodied .

Review:
	darkish straw colored , clear , slightly carbonated , medium head , decent lacing . smell is more sweet than hoppy , not very piney . the hops come out in the taste , but they 're not overwhelming . balanced nicely with a mellow tea-ish flavor . feels light and crisp in the mouth . quite drinkable . i had this for the first time in 2008 and enjoyed it , so i made a point to find it again this year . this review is for the 2009 release of esb .

Review:
	wrong glassware : pint for a weizen . hazy orange color , less than an inch of head . the smell is wheat and fresh hay ; citrus fruits in background ( citron ? ) , and orange peel , strong . the taste is very citric ( too much ) , and a little hint of banana . there is a bitter orange-like bitterness . not vert thirst-quenching ( and it is a weizen ) . medium-low body . in the aftertaste mre lemony and citric again . very peculiar for a weizen , but i do n't like it . at a second taste , the few classic weizen characteristics disappear , and remains just the bitterness . not very drinkable .

Review:
	big thanks to alexgash from ba for the bottle cloudy orange colored pour with a big lasting meringue like head . thick wheaty , banana flavor with lots of clovey yeast smell too . very big strong hef smell with a light lemony wheatiness as well . taste is strong and full bodied with the same flavors . very good quality hefeweizen but just a style i 'm style growing to like slowly .

Review:
	a beer that is not sold in my neck of the woods , but managed to get while on a roadtrip . poured into an imperial pint glass with a generous head that sustained life throughout . nothing out of the ordinary here , but a damn good brew still . body was kind of heavy , but not thick . the hop smell was excellent and enticing . very drinkable

Review:
	12 ounce bottle poured into my stone tulip . pours a deep reddish brown , very pretty . a nice three finger layer of frothy head that settles down into a one inch layer . lots of lacing all around the inside of the glass smell is great too , lots of pine , fruit , malt , and a distinct hop , taste follows through , very bitter and first , but not so much as it continues to set in on the tongue . this beer is not dominated by the hops ; there is an enormous malt presence here alcohol is too high to make this extremely drinkable , but that just goes with the style . still , a damn tasty and impressive beer from weyerbacher .
